 I'd like to keep my review rather to the point.Pros: 1. its theme - dream is a fascinating topic to say the least. There are a lot of unknowns in dreamworld. 2. its plot - there are several sweet twists and unpredictable turns. 3. its edgy drive - although you know what's coming next, still you feel jumpy about it when it does.4. its rapid storyline - the story moves fast from one scene to another, making the viewers feel like on a roller coaster ride. At times, it's hard to keep up, even after watching it several times. 5. its sophistication - there is a lot of information to remember and digest. This is the very thing the modern moviegoers are after, I believe. 6. its realism - okay, pun intended. The movie explains (or at least tries to) the ins and outs of what dream is about and how it functions, some of which are very familiar with and dear to us.Cons: 1. its poor character development - although the acting was convincing enough there was not enough of character development. I wonder how many people really felt connected to the main character(s) after watching the movie. Yes, the movie talks about emotional struggles but it was more of an action film than anything else, if you ask me. 2. too many distractions - I found that the movie had more characters than necessary. They may play certain roles in the plot but they seemed more of distractions than anything else. I wish the movie was more focused. 3. a bit preachy - I noticed that the characters would explain things about dreamworld and then the exact things happen later in the movie. I'm afraid, Inception overused this trick. In conclusion, its theme is fascinating but its delivery is not without room for improvement. I highly recommend you to go and read Somewhere carnal over 40 winks, if you dig this kind of flicks. Cheers! 
 What is the most resilient parasite? An Idea! Yes, Nolan has created something with his unbelievably, incredibly and god- gifted mind which will blow the minds of the audience away. The world premiere of the movie, directed by Hollywood's most inventive dreamers, was shown in London and has already got top notch reviews worldwide and has scored maximum points! Now the question arises what the movie has that it deserve all this?Dom Cobb(Di Caprio) is an extractor who is paid to invade the dreams of various business tycoons and steal their top secret ideas. Cobb robs forcefully the psyche with practiced skill, though he's increasingly haunted by the memory of his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who has a nasty habit of showing up in his subconscious and wreaking havoc on his missions. Cobb had been involved so much in his heist work that he had lost his love!But then, as fate had decided, a wealthy business man Saito( Ken Watanabe) hands over the responsibility of dissolving the empire of his business rival Robert Fischer Jr.(Cillian Murphy). But this time his job was not to steal the idea but to plant a new one: 'Inception'Then what happens is the classic heist movie tradition. To carry out the the task, Cobb's 'brainiac' specialists team up again with him, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), his longtime organizer; Tom Hardy (Eames), a "forger" who can shapeshift at will; and Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a powerful sedative supplier. There is only one word to describe the cinematography, the set designs and the special effects, and that is Exceptional! You don't just watch the scenes happening, you feel them. The movie is a real thrill ride. The action scenes are well picturised and the music by Hans Zimmer is electronically haunting. Never, in the runtime of the movie, you will get a chance to move your eyes from the screen to any other object.Leonardo, who is still popularly known for Jack Dawson played by him in Titanic, should be relieved as his role as Dom Cobb will be remembered forever. His performance may or may not fetch him an Oscar but it will be his finest performance till date. The supporting cast too did an extraordinary work. Christopher Nolan, ah! what a man he is. His work is nothing less than a masterpiece and he deserves all the awards in the 'Best Director' category. If "Inception" is a metaphysical puzzle, it's also a metaphorical one: It's hard not to draw connections between Cobb's dream-weaving and Nolan's film making, intended to seduce us, mess with our heads and leave an ever-lasting impression.To conclude, I would just say before your life ends, do yourself a favor by experiencing this exceptionally lucid classic created by Nolan! My Rating: 10/10Thanks & Regards 
 Usually I try to be careful with over hyping a film, or setting the expectations too high, as film geeks all are guilty for, however for Christopher Nolan's Inception, this really is not possible.This is possibly one of the only perfect films I have ever seen. It is absolutely confident in every way, something which is extremely refreshing, even more so than Avatar. Christopher Nolan gets some slack for making great to look at but ultimately heartless affairs, which I for one do not agree with, however I do not think anyone can argue that here. The emotional aspect of this film not only ties it all together but is really the centre of this film, it is the focus. I do not want to over simplify the film, by simply calling it Kubrick doing Bond, or Gondry on a huge budget, because I am sure it will be called that but it is far more than that, it is something I do not think Kubrick could have ever made. It is pure Nolan, and pure greatness.I hate writing something which is pure fan-boy gushing, but its really difficult here. I did not find a thing I did not like about it, I am sure if maybe I saw it a second time, maybe I would find something about it I didn't like, but not the first time. The way it is cut, means that there is always action on screen, if not, then the visuals are interesting enough to keep your eyes glued.The final hour of the film, is possibly one of the most complicated action sequences put on film. You have to constantly be paying attention to remember all of the layers of what is happening. Without spoiling anything, all I have to say is that is what this film is about, that is what makes this film so great, layers. Once you have seen this you will now what I am talking about.All of the actors are fantastic too, Di Caprio is the stand out here. Yes, this is probably due to the fact he is the star and given all of the emotional weight, but he handles it perfectly, similarly to his performance in Shutter Island. Ellen Page, whom I usually hate, gives a great performance here. Tom Hardy gives a break out performance here, he is quite the bad ass.I hope audiences are ready for a film like this, a pure auteur driven film which does not sacrifice a single frame for the studio. I would hope this film will change Hollywood, as it is 100 percent the directors vision yet it is definitely a marketable film, much like District 9, yet I do not think it will. I cannot recommend this film anymore than I have, I just have to say everyone and anyone should see it. Sorry about all the gushing, it is just so hard not too.If you liked this review check out my new film blog: http://thedeletedscene.wordpress.com 
 Films about dreams and the subconscious are usually not very straightforward and almost always weird. "Inception" is no exception to that rule, but like its cinematic predecessors who have explored the contrast between and the questions of what is real and what is illusion (i.e. "The Matrix" (1999), "The Cell" (2000), "Abre Los Ojos" (1997) & its American remake "Vanilla Sky" (2001)), you really can't look away, nor should you."Inception" is an excellent and breathtaking movie that may be one of the only films released so far during the Summer of 2010 that lives up to its hype. It is a nearly perfect and highly original film that holds your attention until the credits roll. The less you know about this movie going in, the more you will be entranced by seeing it.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb, a world class criminal who, with the help of a team of sleep experts, works his way into people's subconscious and steals what people value most: ideas directly from their minds. In his last assignment to possibly clear his name, he is assigned not to steal an idea from someone, but to plant one inside that person's mind. The difficulty comes when certain people are trained to block their ideas from being taken.That plot summary only covers the basics of this pretty complicated story, but to describe every plot detail would take away the magic of this film you must see yourself to believe. DiCaprio is good in his role, but unlike many other films he has starred in, this is perhaps his only role where his character alone does not carry the weight of the movie on his shoulders or share it equally with one other co-star. Instead, this great ensemble cast teams together to make this movie work, just as their characters collaborate to pull off such a unique heist. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, and Tom Hardy are especially good in their roles.The special effects in this film were also very good, which is amazing considering their simplicity compared to the "Matrix" movies. There are slow-motion shots, but no impossible kung fu fighting sequences. It's especially interesting when the film gets into the architecture of certain dreams, and impossible sequences are filmed in a way I've never seen other than in drawings.However, the special effects would mean nothing if the story wasn't good. For this reason, even something as simple as a spinning top holds your attention in a way you would never think it would when seeing it in this film. The credit here can be given to writer and director Christopher Nolan, who has not made a bad film yet. There are many twists and turns in this film, but Nolan never loses his focus in the process of telling the story. If Nolan does not get nominated for Best Director and/or Best Original Screenplay next Oscar season, there is something terribly wrong with the Academy.That being said, there was still a lot about this film I still don't get, and may require multiple viewings to better understand. However, some of the best films I've seen are confusing at first. "2001: A Space Odyssey" (1968) is a film I've seen a couple of times, and still don't understand completely. It still has a major following, though, as I'm positive this movie will. It's an incredibly entertaining movie, but it also makes you think and continues to do so after you leave the theater. 
 I saw Memento very recently, something that turned out to be a great miss.I saw it again, just to make a couple of thins straight-and i'll definitely do the same with Inception.Christopher Nolan keeps improving himself, with even more complex and multilayer script like this.And i thought Memento was hard to reach by most of the viewers, but no.Inception will keep you mesmerized and captivated by the genius, that's hidden behind it.And not just directors and screenwriters (or with other words-Nolan), but with acting and sound-and effects and editing as well.When you have a cast like this-i mean Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Lewitt, Michael Caine, or Marion Cotillard (a personal favourite), the movie just keeps going flawlessly.Most of the crew is the same the Nolan brothers worked with on TDK and earlier in Batman Begins.So the Oscar noms in those categories are a certainty for me.The only thing one could have against the movie, is the headache one could have.See, most of my friends go to the movies for brainless action, they enjoyed Iron Man 2 and The A-Team, but this movie-you have to see it at least twice, to understand it.The levels and the layers on which thing are happening are so many, that one surely'll miss something vital.This is a reason for not fitting to the mass audience, but i hope that won't happen, because Nolan is one of my favourite directors/writers, and he showed, that the brainless action flicks aren't all of it.There are still movies like Inception out there and still people like the Nolans to make those movies, so it's not all lost.And i hope this movie could show the audience that the story is still important for the experience one could receive, not the endless, constant explosions.Because this is really a one of a lifetime event.Saying that, i must say, that in a world full of remakes, reboots, sequels, prequels and God knows what, this is a unique chance to see something different and unmatched so far-a strong movie, that, surely will be Nolan's latest masterpiece! My Grade won't change-it's the same for all Nolan movies-sheer 10! 
 Dom Cobb leads a highly skilled team, specializing in stealing secrets from people's minds by entering their dreams. When they are hired by a mysterious businessman, Cobb finally has a shot at redemption, but not before achieving the near impossible. Rather than stealing an idea, they must do the complete opposite: Inception. Planting the seed of an idea.Inception has a multi-layered plot, quite literally in fact. It focuses on the emotional journey of its lead character, Cobb, but at the same time thrusts the audience into multiple levels of action packed story- telling, very distinct from one another, but all finely connected. It has been described by critics as "a film that rewards intellect", and I can assure you that it is exactly that. Director Christopher Nolan challenges the audience to keep up, and rewards those who can with a breathtaking spectacle, one that has the capability to leave you awestruck. The best part about it is that while you may feel you need to watch it again to be able to fully absorb the experience, chances are, you will probably want to.Christopher Nolan brings his unique vision to the screen with the help of a star-studded cast, including the likes of Leonardo Dicaprio (The Departed), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (500 Days Of Summer), Ellen Page (Juno), Marion Cotillard (Public Enemies), Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins), and Michael Caine (The Dark Knight), as well some amazing photography by long time collaborator Wally Pfister. The thrilling music in the film is provided by none other than Hans Zimmer, who was also set the mood for Nolan's previous film, The Dark Knight.While it may seem simple at its outset, Inception is an extremely complex film, delving deep into the subconscious of the human mind. Technical brilliance and visual splendor have rarely blended together as beautifully. The emotional depth and explosive action complement each other perfectly, delivering a film that is at the same time both heart- wrenching and heart-pounding. It's a film that manages to engross you with its complexities, yet comes together seamlessly, and will have you at the edge of your seat, quite literally from start to finish.Inception is magnificent. 
 What is going on with the IMDb user reviews lately? It's like the masses can no longer be trusted. In the last month, the users have decreed "Airbender" the worst abomination ever, when in fact it's just an average movie. User reviews raved over "Despicable Me", when it was about as entertaining as a "Dexter's Lab" rerun. And now? "Inception" is the 3rd best movie ever made? Are you kidding me? This was a very creative and interesting flick that went waaaayyy overboard. The problem with this genre (you know the genre -- was it a dream? or a dream about a dream? or a parallel universe where people dream they're dreaming about parallel universes while pretending to dream) is sooner or later you stop caring about the actual action because it's a dream. So the 20 minutes spent watching gunfights and car crashes in the pouring rain, and the 30 minutes spent watching these guys shoot up a ski fortress, and another 30 minutes watching what's-his-name float around a hotel just didn't do it for me. Not a terrible movie, but 3rd greatest movie ever? You must be dreaming. 
 I'm nearly at a loss for words. Just when you thought Christopher Nolan couldn't follow up to "The Dark Knight", he does it again, delivering another masterpiece, one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years. Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird, but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just can't help watching and wondering what will happen next. That is a real powerful skill a director has. No wonder Warner Bros. put their trust in him, he is THAT good of a director, and over-hyping a Christopher Nolan film, no matter what the film is about, is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films before.Not since the eras of Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than Christopher Nolan. He is, undoubtedly, one of THE most brilliant and gifted Hollywood filmmakers in history. Filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime. He has the ability to seduce our eyes, ears and most importantly, mind, and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast. Rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time. And yes, it is similar to the excellent anime film "Paprika" in the whole "invading dreams" plot, but the similarities end there as Nolan brings the film to a whole different level.Visuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time, it's either all-visuals-no-smarts ("G.I. Joe", "Transformers") or the exact opposite ("Doubt", "Invictus"). In this film the excellently directed action sequences combined with immensely groundbreaking and jaw-dropping visual effects are combined smoothly with a heavy dose of intelligence and believability.Although having an ensemble cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio (Warner Bros), this film is a very personal film for Nolan, he wrote the film as well as directing it, and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolan's perplexing, increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up. Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film. This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher, rather it is a film for thinkers. Honestly I can't explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers. Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience. The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed, confused and ultimately breathless. It's like a puzzle, both physically and mentally, and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues. However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the film's humanity, and this is where "Inception" shines. It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come. That's right, years.Once the film ends, you'll want to watch it again, for there's something new every time. This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the film's ambiguous themes, and will be discussed by many in the future. This is an original film, no adaptation, no sequel/prequel, no remake/reboot, which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows ("Avatar" be damned).Of course, a film is not complete without the actors. Leo DiCaprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance, similar but better than his previous effort "Shutter Island". He shows glimpses of a flawed, grim, fragile man, who has knowledge about everything else but yet can't seem to come in grips with himself and his demons. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Michael Caine, Marion Cottilard, Pete Postlethwaite, Lukas Haas... Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their own.Nolan is of course, a master behind the camera, a real virtuoso when it comes to film. His direction is taut, focused, gripping, and extraordinarily fascinating. The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan, considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into pop-culture art two years ago ("The Dark Knight"). The action sequences are unique, exciting and fresh, something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds. The visual effects are awesome and imaginative, and best of all they do not bring down the movie's quality one bit, rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch. The cinematography is absolutely, beautifully shot, so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory. Production design is top notch, with terrific design of sets and locations. Hans Zimmer's complementing music score is simply outstanding, and knowing the man, that's really all I have to say. Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this year.Christopher Nolan has once again outdone himself. He truly is a gifted filmmaker, arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today. And "Inception" can proudly stand alongside "Blade Runner" and "2001: A Space Odyssey" as science-fiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogether.There are two types of films: the crowd-pleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indie/art film. Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package, pulling off that rare, now nearly-extinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots. Movie of Summer 2010? Movie of 2010? Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade! Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent people.Missing this film and not getting the film's point is a crime.Overall value: 9/10 (Excellent) 
 Inception is truly one of a kind. A concept which has long gestated in Christopher Nolan's mind, his eye for drama mixed with his large scale sensibilities ring true in Blockbuster season making Inception a true original in the sea of reboots, remakes and sequels.To try and explain Inceptions many plot twists and incredibly intelligent arcs, would be a foolish task. As Nolan himself has been reluctant to. The best way to approach the film would be with an open mind, if you are prepared to be taken on a ride of a lifetime, then trust that you 100% will. If Avatar was a seminal film in technology (although coming out as a rather poor film, in my opinion), then Inception is seminal in it's storytelling. With a 148 minute running time, you would expect a lot to take place, but what you wouldn't expect is the pace of it all. I did not think at one time in the film about how long was left. I was simply blown away by the depth in every single part of the film. If my enthusiasm for the storytelling aspect of the film has left you worried about the spectacle, then don't worry. They are, as hinted in the trailer, incredible, looking real and unbelievable simultaneously. The most pleasing thing about the action set pieces, is that they are genuinely used to illustrate the story, rather than to blow stuff up a la Michael Bay.With this complex movie in it's high concept, a stellar cast is needed. And Nolan as always, delivers with just that. This is vintage DiCaprio, perhaps only equalled in The Aviator, which is even more impressive as his role as Cobb in Inception is not a showy one, needing DiCaprio to be the constant at the centre of the film. And he pulls off Cobb's emotional contradictions sublimely. The rest of the cast members all shine in parts of the films, Cillian Murphy shows off his usually non-existent tender side, Gordon-Levitt bottles his usual charm for his confidently reserved turn as the reliable Arthur, Watanabe is devilish as the seemingly ambiguous Saito, Page shows why she's the next big female star and Tom Hardy revels in being the comic relief of the film compared to his recent turns as decidedly psychopathic characters.Overall, Nolan has indeed surpassed himself. He has created a world as expansive as his Gotham, a plot dwarfing the intricacies of Memento and one which blows The Prestige's cinematic reveal out of the water. This is truly unmissable cinema. Revel in it, we've still got to wait a whole two years before Batman 3. 
 What do we ask for in a summer blockbuster? What is it that incites hysteria this time every year for whatever dross the studios churn out? Epic hugeness? Blowing stuff up? Romance? Action? Heroes? What are we looking for in a blockbuster? I think it all boils down to thrills! Audiences want the thrill of a car chase, the thrill of romance, the thrill of the spectacular! If that is the case, then Inception just might be the greatest summer blockbuster of all time as it also contains something we often don't look for...brains! "What is the most resilient parasite? An idea" says Leonardo Di Caprio's character Cobb. Well, Inception is all about ideas. It's all right there in the title. The film central idea revolves around "Extractors", who are paid to extract secrets from people's subconscious minds by sneaking into their dreams, usually for the purpose of corporate espionage. However, when one client asks them to plant an idea in the mind of their corporate rival, "Inception" is born. The less said about this film the better. It is full of ideas and invention and for each set piece I divulge, a piece of the film's genius is weakened. This is a film that cleverly and intricately brings the audience through several planes of existence simultaneously but never allows the viewer to feel lost. Such is the power of Christopher Nolan's script which, I imagine, is likely to get overlooked due to the sheer visual magnificence of his direction. But everything that makes this film so great is in the script...in the ideas! Everything else is just spectacle. This film bears an uncanny resemblance, thematically, with DiCaprio's other instant classic this year, Shutter Island. Both films investigate in depth the tricks a traumatised mind can play on the individual. Both films are luscious to watch and both films keep the audience firmly outside the realm of reality. However, Inception is an even more layered film than Shutter Island and I believe the sci-fi genre setting will prove to be less alienating for audiences than the prison noir of Scorsese's film. There is not a single dull moment in Nolan's film. There is style, charm and intelligence in every frame of the film. Every performance is pitch-perfect with some strong support by Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt particularly who have grown up right before our eyes into undeniable movie stars. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a typically flawless performance as the muddled, grieving man who we never quite trust to be living in the real world. The best part of Inception is the large amount of effects which were done in camera. While the film does make use of CGI, there are some pretty mind-blowing practical effects which are as simple as the camera telling beautiful lies; a rare treat these days. This is a blockbuster that ticks all the boxes; smart, sexy (femme fatale, sexy brainy girl, very beautiful men in very beautiful suits) and magical. Inception is the kind of film that reminds me why cinema will never die. Because anyone who thinks it's OK to watch this film on a laptop or iPad is a fool! This is pure cinema, and proud of it. Not to be missed on the big screen! 
 I had the privilege of seeing this movie before it came out, and, like most of DiCaprio's films, it blew me away.Inception is a well-made movie, filmed in about 6 locations all over the world. The directing was outstanding, there were only about two moments, maybe three seconds in total, where i noticed that visual effects were being used (of course defying gravity is pretty difficult). The plot was very pleasingly intricate, with a twist-and-turn, keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat type feel. I noticed that this film had similarities with DiCaprios thriller Shutter Island (which i also enjoyed very much)seeing as it left you wondering what was real and what was not. It's great to see a movie with a thick and emotional plot and not just grenade-throwing action heroes who achieve greatness in the end.Inception also has a very well-composed score, which to me was the finishing touch to a perfect movie. If you're thinking about seeing Inception, definitely go! Even though i was fortunate enough to see a free show, it is worth every penny you pay. Truly unique, like nothing i've ever seen before. Christopher Nolan certainly covered new ground with this film and wasn't afraid to leave us hanging with a spectacular ending. 
 I cannot ignore facts. I cannot ignore mistakes and plot holes, bad writing, or bad marketing. I cannot ignore hype, especially when it's already on the IMDb top 250, it received praise from critics, cashed in a lot of money, and people call it stunning and unforgettable. The simple truth is that Inception does not live up to the hype. Let me start with the trailer. All the coolest things (the folding city, the collapsing cliffs, the train in the street) are totally unessential to the plot. None of that takes more than a few seconds. So why did they put them on all the posters as well? Nevermind. I'll move on to the real problems of the movie.So I heard all these people saying how complex the movie is. How I'll need to watch it twice. How the shocking ending will blow my mind. I knew exactly what that "shocking ending" would be half way through the film. The very last paragraph of this review deals with the ending. It's not exactly a spoiler but you can skip it if you don't want to know anything.Cobb (DiCaprio) takes on a mission to implant a thought into Fischer's (Murphy) mind. As a reward, his contractor Saito (Watanabe) will clean his record with the LAPD. Cobb is wanted for the murder of his wife and consequently he can't return to USA and see his children. Throughout the movie, this is Cobb's main inner conflict, that before he fled the country, he didn't get a chance to see the kids' faces and he wants to see them again. Michael Cain has a very small role as their grandpa and DiCaprio's father-in-law. Why doesn't Cain take the kids someplace so they could be with their father? People move all the time. Or why doesn't he send Cobb some home movies if he wants to see their faces so much? They could even have video calls and all that stuff. It's a long distance relationship but it's something. Well, apparently no one thought of that, and so the main character's main motivation for his actions makes no sense. As for acting, DiCaprio was good. But if you've seen Shutter Island, You've seen a third of Inception. Dead wife, small kids, a sense of loss, a pretty wooden house in a field, all those flashbacks Teddy had in Shutter Island it's all in Inception. Minus the funny Boston accent.The mission these mind thieves embark on is to plant an idea into a rich guy's mind. This is called inception. Hence the title, I guess. Everyone says it's impossible to do, so you know they are going to succeed in the end. Inception is essentially a heist movie, but instead of getting into a vault, Cobb's team has to get inside someone's mind  which happens to look like a vault. The supposed complexity of the movie boils down to the idea of a dream within a dream. Basically, imagine that once you are plugged inside the matrix, you plug yourself into yet another, deeper, matrix. There, I just explained the super complex plot of the movie. But in case that wasn't enough, there is Ellen page's character, Ariadne. She is the obligatory new member of the team that is introduced to represent the audience and their questions. I'm fine with that. Every movie has one of those uninitiated people. The thing is, she understands everything too quickly and becomes suddenly becomes the most competent character. Pretty convenient, if you ask me.Let me finally get to the mission. It's the worst part of the movie. Watanabe wants Murphy, who just inherited a huge corporation, to dissolve it, because it was going to become a huge monopoly. So Watanabe hires DiCaprio to plant the idea of splitting the company in Murphy's mind. And so they do that. For two and a half hours. But I don't care if he splits the big company or not. Why should I care if Murphy has a bigger company than Watanabe? The stakes of the movie aren't high, they are nonexistent. I am not given any reason to care about whether or not they succeed. I'm only given more and more action set pieces to look forward to, and a lot of cool slow motion and zero gravity fights reminiscent of The Matrix, but I'm not given any reason to care for what is happening. I liked Watanabe's character only because I like Ken Watanbe. As for Saito himself, I don't give a damn if his competitor destroys his company or not. They don't tell us what consequences it would have, they don't show us what happens with the company, they don't do anything with this initial idea. Which is strange, because the movie is all about ideas being important. Okay, so I didn't like the plot and the acting was nothing new. What about the rest? Hans Zimmer's unremarkable score works well with the scenes but it would be super boring to hear on its own. The visual effects are good but since all the coolest city-folding scenes were so short, there wasn't really that much to do. The zero gravity stuff was done well, I'll give them that. Cinematography was good, bordering on too much shaky camera.Here's the paragraph about the ending:The big ending is that you are supposed to be unsure what was a dream and what was reality. If it was real, then it's stupid because DiCaprio had dozens of ways to be with his kids without making things so incredibly complicated. The movie is supposed to make you think, but if you think about it the whole plot falls apart. If it was a dream, then it's a stupid cop out on Nolan's part. An excuse for all the things that didn't make sense. It was all a dream, so screw you, audience. 
 Its all a dream. How do you know its a dream? Because it got a 9.4 rating. I'm waiting for a train. Its bringing a real rating of a 4. But the train doesn't come. This is not my dream. Omg. I'm going to wake up, and the real rating will be a 4, like reality. Reality as it should be, if movies were properly rated. But there's an explosion. The movie is still rated a 9.4. If I jump, maybe out of a window and die in my dream, which is someone else's dream, I might wake up to get the real rating of this movie, a 4. The van falls, I'm drowning. Finally after a long long long time, I wake up. Thank god it was all a dream. I check the rating at IMDb. OMG NO! I must still be in someone else's dream.As the big blockbuster movies become more awful, their rating consistently get higher. Any time I see a high rated (7+) new movie on a major rating website I become suspicious now. Too many times I've wasted money on crap movies because the rating said it was good. I guess they decided to push it to the limits of a 10 this time to really fool people like me that are becoming wary.The movie deserves about a 4 out of 10. The 4 is given for the nice colors and pretty good graphics. However, the plot is weak, the characters are weak, its not thought provoking or intellectual. There's no brilliant script or any new directional style here. And it feels longer than a run on sentence.Long. Boring. Jumbled. Good concept and stars wasted on this movie. See it if you have to, but don't spend money on it. Every time we spend money to see bad movies it sends a message that we are willing to accept less, and pay more. Your money is your real vote. Only vote for what is good. 
 I have to say to make such an impressive trailer and such an uninteresting film, takes some doing.Here you have most of the elements that would make a very good film. You have great special effects, a sci-fi conundrum, beautiful visuals and good sound. Yet the most important part of the film is missing. There is no plot, character or soul to this film. It's like having a beautiful building on the outside with no paint or decoration on the inside.It's an empty shell of a film. There is no tension; you couldn't care less about any of the characters, why were they even motivated to do what they did. Helping a corporation get "one over" on another corporation is hardly saving the human race.When you operate in a dream environment, where you can't die or be injured really it means there is nothing to worry about, who cares what happens. All the explosions and actions sequences are just meaningless. By the way, why does Hollywood still keep filming action scene's an inch away from every characters nose? It's impossible to see what's going on, so many films are ruined by this. Watch and learn from the Matrix, take the camera backwards a couple of feet and we can actually work out what's going on.So 2 and half hours of looking at my watch waiting for the very predictable ending, is a million miles from being a good film. How anyone in their right mind can give this 10/10, it's boring and pointless. A film has stir the soul, has to grab you, you need to feel for the characters. Can anyone, honestly say, they cared about anyone on show here.By the way, here's an idea, why don't you bring the children (who haven't aged a minutes since you last saw them) to you, if you can't go to the US.I know the end scene was trying to be ambiguous, but the fact his father, who lives in Paris, is bizarrely there in the US to meet him (how did he know) and the children look identical to every dream sequence they appeared in, means there wasn't much doubt.In the end there is nothing at stake for anyone, so a pointless movie. I suspect Nolan will continue to get praise, but I can't really say I've got excited about any of his movies. They all leave me cold. They are not terrible, just there's nothing really there, no substance. 
 Unless you call this movie a masterpiece. Then you are.Damn 1,000 word limit. Gotta make this quick.Spoilers.The film is 2.5 hours long, yet feels like 5.2, and there are a few reasons for this. One of which is the fact that a preponderance of the first act is amateurish, conflict-free exposition, which does not bode well for repeat viewings.The "learning about the dream world" scene is atrocious. No conflict. Both Leo and Page's characters already knew what was being explained. The similar "learning about the matrix" scene in The Matrix did it right by having one character not know anything. Plus, there was conflict. Neo gets his ass kicked and fails to make the building jump. Much more entertaining.There's another problem with the whole section of bending the landscape where Leo explains the negative aspects of altering the dream world. The closest we get to seeing the dream world altered was Leo becoming Mr. Charlie, yet the most that happens then is a bunch of extras turn and look at Leo. That's it. The idea was not exploited. You literally have to go out of your way to miss that opportunity. Hell, that Mr. Charles scene is shorter than the scene that explains why altering the dream world is bad! Let's not forget this whole idea of one corporation one-upping another has absolutely no personal ramifications for anyone on screen or in the audience. It would have greatly amped up the internal conflict if Leo had to struggle with the notion that helping the guy who could help him would endanger someone else close to him, or us, or someone else. ANYTHING could have worked better than an energy contract that means less to me than my neighbor's bath mat. Come on. The totems were handled very poorly. All we need to know is their purpose. We don't need to know anything else, yet the film keeps piling on needless information.If this is a heist film, where is the threat of being caught? A van falls for an endless amount of time. Joseph Gordon-Levitt floats bodies down a hallway for half an hour, real-time. The guy from Bronson does his thing, whatever the hell that was. These are not complex tasks or events, but rather straight-forward in nature. Dragging them out for a solid chunk of the film is what creates the glacial pace and makes a long film seem even longer.Inception has no real villain. You can make a case for Cotillard, but she is an internal enemy. She never takes a "physical" presence and never threatens anyone except Leo. Everyone else is dealing with faceless assassins. That makes it feel distant from the rest of the action. It doesn't even have anything to do, emotionally, with Leo's goal of getting home to see his kids. None of this is tied together. Leo didn't even know what the hell was going on with Cillian and never even knew of the outcome until after the fact. He's separated from the physical manifestation of his goal for a majority of the film. I ended up not caring if the plan succeeded. If it was all somehow tied together, the audience would be able to experience that great emotional catharsis that everyone was talking about...but that didn't happen.In fact, Leo is so separated from the actual plot that you can literally put Levitt in his place and not even need the hero in the dream world at all! Hell, you can even put Page there, since all she does after designing the boring and lifeless dream worlds is hang out with the guys and tell Leo he's crazy. I really wish she had something else to do besides play the part of the fifth wheel.Leo's lack of involvement in the main action of the story creates a 'so what?' moment when the problem is solved for him, and I can think of absolutely no reason why the hero should not be the one to conquer the main conflict. Brody kills the shark in Jaws. He doesn't send Hooper and Quint out to do his dirty work while he stays behind to deal with his fear of water. It's integrated. The hero is forced into dealing with the physical, and in turn, but learn to conquer his internal fears before he can conquer his external opponent. This is Screen writing 101, Lesson 1, and Nolan got that wrong. That's why I don't believe the reports that he spent 10 years writing the script since it only took me 148 minutes to figure out exactly what was wrong with it.Not to mention the conceit that to enter someone else's dream and control it means that you would have to control your own subconscious, which they state elsewhere is impossible. Way to go, genius.Pretty much everything this film does wrong, The Matrix does right. Watch that instead.PS: The 'taking a scene from the middle and putting it at the beginning' gag reached its peak effectiveness in 2002 and has absolutely no place in modern films. It's getting as bad as that tired old 'It's all a dream' scenario. Oh, wait... 
 I will try not to repeat some of what others have so brilliantly written in some reviews. I just add this in order to contradict the hype that has allowed this movie to be ranked so high in IMDb. The same has been happening with other movies, and that is a shame for IMDb, which is becoming unreliable.I want to stress the fact that the only complexity in this movie is trying to figure out how you can invest so much money in a script that continuously makes a fool of the average critic intelligent viewer! The story is not complex. It is deliberately confusing in order to conceal its stupidity. Nothing that really matters is explained in the movie.And there's so many embarrassing clichés (the recruiting of the team, the episode in Mombassa, the assault of the ice fortress, many of the action sequences)... the average viewer must be disappointed!And the dreams - which serve as the scenario to most of the movie - are populated by the utmost lack of imagination.Finally, there's the score, louder and louder, building a suspense that is never there, for everything is a dream, and we do not quite catch what there is exactly that can go wrong...Well, all in all, the movie is an insult to the average intelligent viewer and, having been directed by Christopher Nolan, an ultimate disappointment. 
 The central idea of "Inception" is an interesting one: technology exists to enter other people's dreams in order to steal their most private secrets or to implant new ideas. With Christopher Nolan of "Memento" fame as writer and director, this should have been a smart, compelling movie. Unfortunately, "Inception" is a bloated failure.The root problem is that Nolan replaces the fascinating surrealism of dream worlds with lengthy outtakes from James Bond movies. For example, early in the film, when Cobb and Ariadne are sitting at a café in a dream world, Cobb tells Ariadne to stay calm. What's going to happen? Is the waiter going to bring her a glass full of wriggling eyeballs? Is she going to turn around and see her best friend from high school having sex with Abraham Lincoln? No. THINGS START EXPLODING. And that's the whole movie in a nutshell: gaudy special effects and endless fight scenes as a poor substitute for imaginative ideas.The matryoshka-doll plot of dreams within dreams isn't nearly as hard to follow as one might imagine. This is largely because nothing of consequence happens at higher levels once our heroes have moved on to deeper levels. The higher-level supporting actors just fight off bad guys -- and overblown special effects -- until it's time to bring back their colleagues from the depths.Nolan should sit back, watch a few of the best movies by Luis Bunuel and David Lynch, and try again with one-tenth the budget and ten times the imagination. (Okay, that's never gonna happen, but it's *my* dream.) 
 Many of us, not least those who populate the online world with movie reviews, observations and criticisms, are aware of Chris Nolan's raw talent. Memento broke onto the screen a decade ago and provided us with a spectacle in story telling so rare that it dumbfounded us. Since then, Nolan has gained huge popularity with his revival of the Batman franchise, and even more so with the stunning Dark Knight - that still has yet to relinquish its grip on modern day cinema - with the genius of The Prestige sandwiched in between.None of this, however, could have quite prepared us for the spectacle that is INCEPTION. A script that has been worked on for over a decade, Nolan's endeavours are inescapable in its pure complexity and brilliance - quite simply, one of the best film story lines audiences will have encountered in their lifetime. All this is supplemented superbly by the film's ensemble cast - DiCaprio's performance cannot easily be done justice without seeing it. With this and Shutter Island, now must be the time for his first Oscar - he has asserted his place as truly one of the best actors currently working. All reviews will confirm that Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Tom Hardy and Ellen Page back his performance up superbly with well-worked turns. Inception's action sequences play out wonderfully, being - along with the comic relief and back-stories - an integral part of the film's unravelling, whilst we remain rooted to the film's emotional stakes, which give immense purpose to the film's complex and layered narrative.Our protagonist battles with both outer and inner demons in his quest for redemption. The unique concept of entering dreams offers the opportunity not only for a unique species of heist but also a way to dig deeper and deeper into one's subconscious, and the ability to plant an idea which could define that person, or destroy them. In theaters around the world, Nolan uses his dynamic skill to plant an idea in our minds which together allows us to experience the very dream- share the film explores, one which will remain with us long after the film's emotional climax. Inception is a cinema experience so audacious, so incredible, and in the end so gratifying, that it truly is unmissable, and will remain a benchmark for many filmmakers in years to come.10/10. 
 What do David Lynch, Luis Bunuel and Wes Craven have in common? They have all created far superior films about dreams on a fraction of Christopher Nolan's budget. For a film about dreams everything looks so dull and drained of color. Inception never feels surreal like a dream. It feels like ridiculous PG-13 action sequences strung together by character's explaining it's all a dream within a dream etc. When watching this film, I thought of far superior films about dreams and alternate realities, Bunuel and Dali's "Un Chien Andalou" (1929), "The Blood of a Poet" (1930), "The Wizard of Oz" (1939), Hitchcock's "Spellbound" (1946), "Meshes of the Afternoon" (1947), Dr. Sues' "5,000 Fingers of Dr. T" (1953), "Le Jetee" (1962), Fellini's "8 1/2" (1963), "Kingdom of Crooked Mirrors" (1963) Fellini's, "Juliet of the Spirits" (1966), "Who Wants to Kill Jesse" (1966), "Valerie and her Week of Wonders" (1970), "Viva La Muerte" (1970), "The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie" (1972), Tarkovsky's "Solaris" (1972), "The Hourglass Sanitorium" (1973), "Eraserhead" (1977) "Altered States" (1980), "Time Bandits" (1981), Pink Floyd's "The Wall" (1982), "Forbidden Zone" (1982) "Videodrome" (1983), "A Nightmare on Elmstreet" (1984), "Dreamscape"(1984), "Brazil" (1985), "Paperhouse" (1988), The B-movie "Beyond Dreams Door" (1989), "Santa Sangre" (1989), "Jacob's Ladder" (1990), "Kurosawa's Dreams" (1990) "Total Recall" (1990), "Naked Lunch" (1991), "Arizona Dream" (1993), John Carpenter's "In the Mouth of Madness" (1995), "12 Monkeys" (1995),"City of Lost Children" (1995), "Lost Highway" (1997), "Dark City" (1998), "The Matrix" (1999), "eXistenZ" (1999), "Being John Malkovich" (1999), "The Cell" (2000), "Waking Life" (2001), "Donnie Darko" (2001), "Muholland Drive" (2001), "Demon Lover" (2002), "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" (2004), "Strange Circus" (2005), "The Fall" (2006), "The Science of Sleep" (2006), "Pan's Labrynth" (2006), "Paprika" (2006) and the list goes on and on and on. 100's of French and Asian films; hell, even the "Nightmare on Elmstreet" sequels.In "Inception" Leonardo Dicaprio plays Dom Cobb, a dream thief who can enter people's dreams and steal top secret information. Like his character in "Shutter Island" (which had better dream sequences) Leo is obsessed with his dead wife and longs to go home to see his kids. He's given a mission by a corporate boss to enter a rival's dream and implant false information. By completing this mission, he'll be able to go home to his kids. Dom hires an architect played by Ellen Page to create false dream worlds. Then there's his agents, who are one dimensional rip offs of characters from "The Matrix" (A far more entertaining film) For a film about dreams, you'd expect a little Fruedian sex or nudity. Oh no we don't want are dreams to go beyond a mass-marketed PG-13 rating. Or how about at least abstract surrealism or stream of consciousness dialog? Instead we have all the character's taking time out to explain everything to Hans Zimmer's overblown music. In the words of Ariadne "Wait, Who's subconscious are we going through exactly?". That's odd, a shootout on skis, "James Bond" style and Look I'm floating like in "The Matrix" (Lets not get to bizarre or fun) Maybe, I'm being critical, because I'm by no means a fan of Christopher Nolan. "Momento" and "The Dark Night" were good films, but should never be mentioned in the same breath as HItchcock or Kubrick. People really anger me comparing Inception to "Blade Runner", or "2001, A Space Odyssey". Even "Avatar" had more heart and soul than "Inception". In "Avatar", I actually cared about the characters and felt like I was in a different world. In this film how am I supposed to care for rich corporate suits who want to steal secrets. How about having an Exxon executive jumping in the dreams of a BP executive? If it's all a dream within a dream within a dream of one dimensional Hollywood characters, why should the audience care? And why take 150 mins. to tell a story, when it could of been done in less than 2 hrs.?On one note, the special effects were impressive and the film did have great acting. I think this film could of been good if it was more colorful and dreamlike and maybe 45 mins. shorter. "Inception" fell cold and flat of having a heart and soul. Why do films now look gray, poo brown or washed out in color? Movies used to be so much brighter. Compare this film to "Suspiria" (1977), "What Dreams may Come" and "Edward Scissorhands" and you'll see what I mean. Spending $200 million dollars on a film that could of fed a 3rd world country for 10 years, is more of a nightmare than a dream. All that money spent and it still looks visually boring, artless and dull. As a person who practically makes minimum wage and lives off Ramen noodles, I watch sci-fi and fantasy films for an escape. Why would I care about a rich corporate rival who has a bad relationship with his father? Boo-hoo! In the end I felt like I was viewing the unimaginative dreams of Wall Street brokers. This is a film made by a room fool of people, rather than an artist with a vision. A mass marketed product like fast food, masquerading itself as nutrition. For this film to be in IMDb's top 5 is a joke; this is mediocre at best. People are saying that this is better than "The Wizard of Oz", "Pulp Fiction", "Blue Velvet" or Citizen Kane". I must be dreaming, no I kicked myself and this is for real. 
 This film really let me down.I didn't expect a great film but I expected something that was at least 'OK'. How wrong I was. I honestly can't understand the hype. 'Intelligent' they say?? What sort of intelligent film has to have it's protagonists explain what is happening continuously throughout the film?? Now Memento, that was a good film. And, I suppose, 'intelligent'. But by intelligent, I mean something that pushes boundaries of the viewer's understanding. I don't mean intelligent as in 1) able to do simple arithmetic, 2) develop reading and writing skills and 3) generally being one notch above a dolphin.OK, let's make a start shall we? Firstly, one of the greatest literary and cinematic arts is the use of metaphor. This film has none. One thing the film is full of is too much explanatory dialogue (not to mention pre-teen psychology - the father figure relationship in the subconscious). For example, in the first Matrix film, the viewer understands the profundity of what is being delivered through metaphor (a feature that the subsequent Matrix films sadly missed). In this film here, everything is painstakingly explained. To me, this speaks volumes.Secondly, great actors, yes. BUT ALL miscast and given appalling dialogue in an appalling script. I mean, Ellen Page was great in Juno, but here she comes out with painfully mechanical lines in the same way that Joseph Gordon-Levitt also does. In the same way that every character does. They ALL speak the same way and we are no better understanding one character by the end of the film than we were when they first appeared.Thirdly, logic. Philosophy. Call it what you want. Why was Ariadne chosen to become the architect? What does she actually DO??And Ken Watanabe. Why is he alive after dying on the third or fourth level 'down' in the subconscious after the film so adamantly stresses the dangers of dying in the 'dream'? How can he wake up on the plane?? Why, in fact, is there that scene at the start of the film where he appears old and which features the safe and the confidential papers Leonardo De Caprio finds.Why does Leonardo De Caprio constantly have to furrow his brow? Oh, yes, it's a vain attempt to look mean and manly because the poor man still has, unfortunately for him, such a baby face.Why is Cillian Murphy's character chosen to be their means of helping LDC's character get back to his kids? And isn't it convenient to have a dream sequence in a blockbuster that resembles a James Bond film snow-covered chase scene? Why does the film have to go on for two and a half hours instead of one and a half? And most importantly, if Leonardo De Caprio's character is so severely screwed up about his wife why, o why does he have to be the main character in this film? Couldn't the team work with someone more well-balanced?? Can he in fact be any use to his kids if he eventually finds them???Nonsense nonsense nonsense. Big pile of nonsensical psycho-babble. And yes, where else but America??? 
 Christopher Nolan has done some great work.His ideas and direction singlehandedly gave new life to the beloved superhero Batman.While the film Dark Knight will always be recognized to the new dimensions it added to the classic Batman series of movies and comics, Inception was nothing more than a dull and linear plot, surrounded by and an even duller and more linear plot.The centerpiece of this movie was supposed to be its convoluted storyline which was scattered across multiple levels, in essence puzzle that forces the viewer to think through the movie and decipher the ending.The concept of "levels" and or "interconnected plots" worked very well for such great films such as the Matrix, 2001 A Space Odyssey, Logan's Run, or Total Recall. Inception not only miserably fails at this but it also lacks in other places as well.-Characters: Great actors, whom have all done great work in many movies spanning decades. However the characters in this movie came off as neutered eunuchs who lacked sense, emotion, and any sort of cohesiveness. (Sir Michael Caine and Tom Berenger's performances were appalling and the "team" of dreamers lacked screen dynamics and chemistry.) -Action: For a dream world, the action in this movie is very unimaginative and is well within the typical Hollywood bounds. Car cash scenes where the heroes drive and shoot, building shootouts, and melodramatic bullet wounds (as always one character is wounded critically, the team must save him; however the character can still "fight".) -Plot: This movie could have easily been over within 1 hour of rolling. Not only was Inception's "puzzle ending" blatantly obvious 40 mins into the film, but the storyline it self lacked any substance or draw. The overly complicated "puzzle piece" effect which Nolan was trying to achieve, was nothing more than the main story line being surrounded by excessive fluff and whimsical bullplop.*I will credit the movie with one notable mention. Nolan managed to work a Matrix style fight scene (which have been overdone by Hollywood since the early 2000s) into the small confines of an elevator.In the ending, Inception is not the great rave that many make it out to be. While the movie takes place in a "dream world", where bounds are limitless, the movie itself is sterile, cliché, repetitive, and unimaginative. This is even further compounded by one dimensional characters, and a drawn out storyline that pretends to be an enigma.Perhaps Christopher Nolan's true intent was to make a sterile and lack luster movie aimed strictly at making today's self-absorbed and obtuse Facebook-hipster generation feel "smart".Inception can be compared to a class presentation where the student is unprepared. To hide this, the student uses convoluted and circular logic to stammer through the presentation and pass the time. It is obvious that the student knows nothing and has wasted several minutes talking about a subject that could have been explained in seconds. Nonetheless, since the student used "big words", talked excessively, and is deemed to be in the "mainstream" the class gives a standing ovation regardless... 
 easily one of the worst films ever made, that some critics fell for it, just shows how bad today's professional critics have become. no doubt all the 14 to 18 year old Nolan fan boys are going to attack all of us, that have seen through this psycho babble non sense. ultimately the worst thing about the film is that it was utterly boring, from start to finish. at no time to you feel anything for any characters, the dialogue is of such a juvenile nature he must have got a 14 year old to write it. the guy has no idea of what dreams are what takes place during them, i will not go into any philosophical or psychological discussion here as the film does not warrant them, giving there is no sense in anything that is said or done. like dark knight this will have its time in the sun and in a few years the very same people who raved about it will wonder why. as for the ending with the top still spinning telling the audience that anyway it was all still a dream, totally makes the whole exercise futile. shame that a once good film maker has gone right up his proverbial 
 Well, first of all, I have to absolutely clearly admit that I'm writing this review to lower the rating of this movie, since it was one of the biggest movie disappointments of my life. Currently 9.1 for this thing is unbelievably high. But I guess I get why the rating of this movie is so high. It makes the people feel good about themselves because they understood the "complicated" plot. Yes, thats it! Inception actually managed to plant the idea to the people that it was a good movie. At best its an average action movie with too long boring action scenes with the "added value" of a "smart" story. However the story is not smart at all. Its about people that somehow are able to get into people's dreams and do stuff there, or even go to dreams in dreams, and dreams in dreams in dreams, and limbo... Wow, you get it? You are really smart, and should rate this movie 10!!! But seriously, this story is really stupid. Why should I care that the Japanese guy wants to destroy the other guy's (the scarecrow from Batman) company? How did the architect girl become expert on dreams and psychology after two dream sessions? How are they even able to get into the dreams? I guess the acting overall is not bad, but who cares if the plot is so annoying. And finally, the twist at the end is really predictable. Yay, the spinning thing stops to spin: he might be dreaming! Really original. You might say that I did not get the message of the movie. Well, I did get it, but it was too stupid to care about it. 
 Inception didn't bring anything fresh and original like everybody's claiming it has and calling this an intellectual movie is an insult. It tried, but it didn't succeed due to poor, nonsensical writing.The soundtrack doesn't match the movie, it's too suspenseful in a movie with no suspense whatsoever.The mission is something I can't really connect with and I don't know who can really.There was really no sense of any danger at any point as it was all in a dream(s) and the limbo idea didn't make any sense. And by using that limbo concept on the character you couldn't care less if he lived or died, come on, who would care about a multi-millionaire asshole that's trying to get even richer by destroying his competition? He couldn't go back to the US because "They think I killed her"? Is that how the law works now, there was no evidence that he killed her, no witnesses, nothing, he would never be convicted for it, Leonardo, go back and go to court please ;-) They could have used more imaginative dream worlds instead of Dark knights Gotham city in day time, James Bond ice Fortress style and a Matrix like corridor (hallway).The faceless subconscious militia, booooring. Or maybe the problem is that the subconscious of all of these people have no imagination. How come there was no crazy dream like scenes in a movie about dreaming? My dreams are much more interesting than the scenes of this movie...I could go on and on but I just want to lower this high rating, because 9 out 10 is 3 or 4 more than this movie deserves. 
 Just to start off, I read about 20 pages of reviews of this movie and had a few things of my own to add. I actually had to register to IMDb so I can explain why this movie is so bad. Seeing that this piece of garbage is rated 9 out of 10 made me wanna vomit. But enough about that, let's get to the serious issues with this movie. 1: Leonardo DiCaprio has not changed his role for the last 5 years. Am I the only one that notices this? He always plays some guy that has deep seated emotional issues relating to the loss of a loved one. Can he play anything else besides the loner that lost the love of his life and now has psychological scars that go so deep they hit the street he's standing on? 2: Why didn't they shoot his stupid wife anytime she showed up? He wasn't the only guy on the team that knew she was out to mess things up. Why not say, "Hey guys, if you see my wife shoot her because she's going to get us all killed. She's not real and is already dead, so go ahead and blow her away so we can get back to work."? 3: The dream world was the dullest I have ever seen. "Oh man...M.C. Escher stairs, a train driving down the street, buildings that go sideways and upside down..." That's all they could come up with? "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" was more imaginative than the supposed "dream-world". I'm pretty sure most dreams have more random stuff than that happen in them. Where's the off-the-wall imagination? I don't think anyone that says they had "the weirdest dream" explains it as, "Well the world was the same, but a train showed up." "And?" "That's it. Everything else was completely normal." Weak. 4: If I wanted to watch "Call of Duty," I'd play the game. All of the shoot-out scenes looked like they were taken from "Game Informer" magazine screen shots. 5: How come when they went to Limbo, it was in DiCaprio's mind? Can anyone explain that? Is there just one Limbo that in all this movie world's history of dream exploration, but only he and his stupid wife got to and did stuff in? Or was his team (two of whom knew how messed up in the head he was) too dumb to say, "Why don't we keep you out of this and go into someone else's head just in case this turns out badly?". 6: As far as 9 out of 10, (really folks?) go watch "Citizen Kane," "Lawrence of Arabia," or even "The Dark Crystal" if you want a good movie that can stand-up to even the most mediocre critical observation. 
 This movie is so predictable that it takes all of 10 minutes to figure it out. At that stage you know you're going to waste another 2 and a half hours watching the nonsense where people slip in and out of dreams in an attempt to fabricate a story where there was no story.The plot starts in the first few minutes and ends in the last few minutes, everything in between... well... is better left unwatched.If you haven't figured it out immediately, then chances are you won't by the time it's over, in which case you're also wasting 2 and a half hours of your time.The only thing I got from watching this horrible overrated bloated cinematic experiment was a wish to kill myself. Maybe I'm dreaming, too? 
 UNDERWHELMING, LITERAL AND PRETENTIOUS.. These 3 words pretty much summed up the whole of Inception. Why populate the dream world with the same landscape and tone as the real world? Why the dreamers and their subconscious armed with real-world accessories and firearms? Why must the travel initiated with the actor's pretend sleep? Why does the levels are differentiated with only different decor? (Except the LIMBO realm) WHERE IS THE IMAGINATION? Nolan has the perfect opportunity to execute his wildest imaginations and he messed it up and served us mediocrity. Apparently, he only has the most literal interpretation of dreams. No quirky visual manifestation (mirror-world? top-down switched?), no mystical representation of the subconscious (shadows, shades, animals etc), No difference between dream levels (tones-darker?grayer?more grotesque?), No symbolic representative of weapons ( energy? aura's? light? dark? ). AND OF COURSE, the travel method!NOLAN could've presented a more sophisticated facade. Maybe a dream room with vivid machines powered with mysterious matter. Or for mobility, more visible contraptions for head, neck or body. Then, the transition can be cued with portals, or one's self entering the target's body or....to be more fantastical; the reality bleeds or tears itself into an underworld which is the dream.INSTEAD, what we've got is inferior chase and action set pieces. Save for the gimmicks of collapsing the landscape onto itself, making pathways, the movie's rather bland. It also features too many characters - the forgers, architects, point man, sedative-man, corporate-sponsor man.......you get it. IT SHOULD be anchored by one solid protagonist that's let say have a latent talent for some form of ability (dream-walker but is named with Latin words), his target and the source of his internal conflicts (family, lover, friend).This movie fools layman into thinking that they're smart.IT is basically an inferior imitation of Michael Bay's summer blockbuster disguised as a thinking man's movie. IT'S ABOUT CORPORATE ESPIONAGE - Tell people that and it would be 100% true. CERTAINLY NOT travel between dream worlds.... 
 I would have honestly given the movie a 7 but the current rating is very undeserving and I had no choice but to make the least contribution I could make to it. The writer/director of Inception thought if maybe they pretended to have a very complex plot and great special effects, the audience would not realize how pointless the whole story is. The audience were like; "OH! Such a complex plot! A Genius!! A Masterpiece!!" The first hour and a half all they do is explain the whole inception system without moving the plot forward. I am sure most of the audience didn't get what the movie was about but they pretended so they would not look stupid. And Christopher Nolan is going;"I don't really think of films in terms of light and dark...blah blah blah! I am a genius! blah blah blah! ...thriller that takes place in the mind...blah blah blah! I am a genius! blah blah blah!" The intention of the film clearly reflected on itself. The point was not to entertain audience but rather it was a show-off of what artistic capability the director/writer possesses. It tried to point out the fact what a movie genius Christopher Nolan is. I mean I love this guy. The Prestige was great and so was the Dark Knight. But Inception was really showing off. Look at Kick-Ass, Watchmen and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. They were complete honest movies. Their intentions were clean and they reflected in the movie. They were meant for pure entertainment and that's what we got. On the other hand Inception was trying too hard. I could really point the fact on how the intentions of the movie was showing off but I would rather suggest the audience to watch the movie once again. They said the movie was very unpredictable. Suppose there is a man chopping onions in the movie and suddenly the chopped onions turned into a chicken. Now would that be predictable? They might say Cobb's wife living with him till old age in the dream was unpredictable. Are you serious!! How come you haven't seen that one coming!! It was so obvious! It is only the fact the way it was dramatized that made it seem unpredictable and shocking. Top 10 in the IMDb chart!!! Are you kidding me!! 
 Surrealism can appear to be ineffably bizarre, or inquisitively titillating, depending purely on the viewer's intellect. Though the realm of surrealism is highly nebulous and complex, but even a slight attempt at improvisation can sometimes go awry and open a Pandora's Box, making the task highly improbable and nigh impossible. This facet of reality may pose a handicap to the most gifted of the directors, but not to the genius of Christopher Nolan, who not only dabbles with the concept of surrealism, but also ingeniously blends it with the elements of Science Fiction in his latest wonder named Inception. Nolan created a niche for himself a decade back by unleashing a monster of a movie called Memento. He further substantiated his status by conjuring movies like Insomnia, The Prestige, Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight. His unremitting desire for innovation and uncanny craving to foray into the unexplored realms of imagination deservedly earned him an auteur tag, which gave him the carte blanche that a story-teller like Nolan desperately needs. It's highly apparent that Nolan takes every possible advantage of this liberty while filming Inception. Inception is not only dreamlike, but is a dream in itself and is superior to any other thing conceived on the silver screen. With its entwined layers, the movie for the most part serves as an unfathomable riddle and makes multiple viewing extremely essential. It incredibly does extremely well on both the humanistic as well as the technical fronts. In fact, the balance between human emotions and the elements of Science Fiction is so adequate that it's impossible to separate them. The movie is about a futuristic world where the human mind can be intercepted through dream invasion. Cobb is an expert in the art of extracting information (stealing valuable secrets) from deep within the subconscious in the dream state. His proficiency in extraction is marred by a turmoil that begins with his wife's untimely death. He is forced to live the life of a fugitive away from his children. His only chance for redemption lies with a Japanese tycoon named Saitu, who wants him to do an inception (planting information into someone's mind). In order to accomplish this unprecedented task, Cobb and his team must overcome a labyrinth of unforeseeable challenges, where even a slight miss could trap them in a perpetual limbo. Any further revelation would be remissness on my part as the plot is filled with such intricacies that even expatiation would be incapable of justifying its profundity. Leonardo Dicaprio gives a solid performance in the lead role, following his memorable performance in Shutter Island. He has brilliantly depicted the complexities and limitations of Cobb's enigmatic character highlighting his pain and mental trauma. Marion Cotillard is ravishingly scintillating as Cobb's whimsical wife, Mal. The rest of the cast has given a thorough performance with special mention of Ken Watanabe, Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.Inception is incredibly brilliant as a movie and is a breakthrough in contemporary cinema. Nolan's creativity and his unparalleled execution definitely make it an object of great cachet, but whether it would become Buñuel's 'Un chien andalou' or Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' and serve as a prototype for the movies to come is for the time to decide. Irrespectively, Inception is sine qua non not only for an aficionado, but also for the average viewer, who is willing to delve deep enough to savour the delight.PS: One has to imagine it to believe it. 9/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/ 
 Alright, so here's the thing; yes, it was cool that there was all that complexity. Yes, it was cool that there were so many layers of thought both on screen and off to what was going on. Yes, it was cool that Chris Nolan managed to make something unique and fairly independent in just one movie that was complex enough to account for a whole trilogy of movies in almost any other genre. But here's the thing; it had some rather alarming logical leaps that I could not get over.1.The Projections; Okay, so the things that inhabit the streets of the person's subconscious are manifestations of the various components of their brain as evidenced by the fact that when the characters need to find something out about the dreamer's perception of someone else they just follow that manifestation in the dream. Makes sense, because that thought does what the dreamer thinks it would do, not what the real person would do. When I saw that I went 'wow, that makes sense! Clever!', but then towards the end of the movie they say 'nevermind, they're just projections; they don't actually mean anything, and parts of their minds aren't being killed.' That was a little too convenient for my liking.2.The Totems; WHY doesn't the top fall over in the dream world? WHY does it keep spinning perpetually? Everything else obeys the laws of basic physics, so why wouldn't that? That was probably the dumbest thing I've seen in a movie this year; there wasn't even an attempt made to explain it. I can honestly say this was just as bad as 'only a prime can kill a prime' in Trasformers 2.3. The Architect/Dreamer Relationship; Why can only the architect choose the world they enter? And why is the only person who 'projects' characters into this world the person that's 'the dreamer'? They are ALL dreaming, every single one of them, so they should ALL be both altering the world they're in and the characters in it. And why can't the projections do anything cooler than be normal guys with guns? If I detected intruders in my mind I'd summon a nuke or Godzilla or Optimus Prime to get them out, not boring henchman who probably wouldn't be able to get the job done anyways.4. The Script, and it's supposed 'surprises' I felt kind of talked down to when they honestly expected it to be a surprise when you discovered that Molly's death was as a result of Cobb's previous inception. If ANYONE made it through that movie without figuring that out they deserve to be jettisoned into the sun for their stupidity. I caught on the moment he mentioned that inception was possible.5. Waking Up/Dying in the Dream When you die in the dream world you come back up a level towards consciousness, as evidenced by the fact that they wake up when they get shot in the face in the first scene. But wait! When they die in the dream you actually go down to limbo as evidenced by that happening to the oriental guy, which sucks because that's where it's just 'pure subconscious' and you wake up a vegetable. But wait! You actually aren't in an endless limbo because Cobb and Molly went there once, but you still wake up a vegetable. But wait! You actually don't wake up a vegetable because Cobb and Molly didn't when they killed themselves on the train tracks. But limbo is still bad.......right? Because you can't get out without becoming mentally handicapped, but if you can kill yourself to get out at any time just like a normal dream then why is limbo even bad? And isn't inertia supposed to wake you up? Technically the van falling off the bridge should have woken them up, or even it rolling, not it hitting the water. If the force of hitting the water is what woke them up, then shouldn't anything like a slap to the face do it? In the end the movie suffered from the EXACT same things The Dark Knight did, and that is Chris Nolan's conflicting desires to make something believable and for sensationalism, and both cancelling out the other. If you wanted to compare it to the other obvious similar franchise,The Matrix actually is believable. Oh, yeah, now that I think of the matrix, how does a tiny needle plugged into their wrist plug them into an alternate reality in Inception? The base of the skull made sense, this is just silly. People keep saying this is the next Matrix, but the difference here is that literally twenty views later everything in the Matrix STILL makes sense, and I punched holes in this latest Leonardo Decrapio movie in one sitting. Pathetic. 
 I have never lost interest in a film faster than this one, and I have watched some pretty terrible movies e.g. paranormal activity! (like when the girl gets dragged a...way! OMG never laughed so much in my life b4!) . It was a ridiculous waste of resources that could have been put towards ... I dunno folding socks? How they managed to make it so "popular" I do not know.It was pretentious more than anything. It had this strange, "this is the best film of all time because we folded a street over" vibe to it. It was nothing but special effects which i must say were nice but the actual story itself was perpetuated with unspecified technology, chemicals, rules and really bad acting from some really good actors! When you watch a film of this caliber and I use the term lightly, you should be entertained, not bored and scared. They told the story in less than five minutes!***** Don't read this bit if you plan on watching the film ******* They have to change the mind of a guy whose dad is dying; for money and they do it by going into his brain in three levels THAT IS ALL IT IS! SERIOUSLY THAT IS THE WHOLE STORY ALL THE REST IS FILLER!!!!!*******************************************************************They might of as well put in Peter Griffin grabbing his knee in pain and the naive audience would be none the wiser. It isn't a clever film! It isn't even entertainment. It's just noise! 
 Wow what have we here? What hast thou put before our eyes? Could it be Christopher Nolan's boorish tripe 'Inception'? I myself could not tell as the movie was far too low brow to make even the slightest impression on my vastly superior intelligence. Nolan is an amateur who makes movies based on blatantly foreseeable childish artifices that only the most unintelligent boors would find the least bit amusing. 'Inception' is the kind of film designed to make lamebrains feel like they are intelligent. Nolan's intellectualism-for-dummies should be the main title of his biography. Luckily I am smart enough to see past this charade and give the people their fair assessment of this tripe.'Inception' is built upon the notion of traveling through dream like spaces that bend time, space, and reality, yawn. It's been done before Chris in a much sounder fashion in Charlie Kaufman's epic masterpiece 'Synecdoche, New York'. That film is an orgasmic experience while 'Inception' is just beyond words describing it. I mean you might conclude that the inner subconscious would be more creative in coming up with better metaphors for security than guys with guns who chase you. The lengthy exposition- oh I mean training montage, despite having a semi-acceptable computer effect, was way more boring and less engaging than the scene it stole from 'The Matrix', and at least that scene didn't have Nolan's pretentiousness. Larry the Cable Guy is less insulting to the intellect. I mean Sarah Palin sounds smarter than Christopher Nolan's dialogue. ( Conjointly, the Herculean careener of mesh networks is titled Ariadne? Really? None of the juveniles that give you your millions will get that reference Chris but I'm glad you know how to use wikipedia) 
 Don't get me wrong, Christopher Nolan (writer, producer and director of this movie) is a very, very talented filmmaker. He will undoubtedly make that masterpiece for which he will be remembered. But that's just my point: he hasn't made it yet. The Dark Knight wasn't it and Inception certainly isn't it. Inception is a product of a director who has been given carte blanche. His vision has been put on film without someone ever saying: 'Chris, that's not going to work.' For that matter, Inception should have been Nolan's Heaven's Gate. But Inception will probably make Nolan a even bigger star. He better check his totem I felt compelled to write a review when I found out this movie had a 9.2 rating and a 3rd place overall in the top 250. Let me say: that is ridiculous. To balance the scale, I have rated this movie (a ridiculous) 1. I agree with some posts on the message board of IMDb: complex does not mean intellectual or smart. And for that matter, I don't think this film is very complex. It just asks what most movies do: go with it.DiCaprio gives a pretty good performance (with leftovers from his role in Shutter Island) as Dobbs, a person who is able the penetrate someone's dream and see or steal his secrets. Recently Dobbs lost his wife and he has not seen his children in a long time. That is because the authorities think he has something to do with his wife's death. Watanabe gives Dobbs a chance to get his life back. He needs to plant an idea (inception) in the mind of a competitor. Like a seed, it will grow. And the inspiration for the idea will seem real.One of the problems for me with the movie was that the dreamworld felt pretty flat and boring to me. Unlike The Matrix (a inception for this movie), the inhabitants of the other world do not bend the rules of gravity. The laws of physics do apply. That's not a bad decision. But I agree with one reviewer: 'Nolan's dreamworld looks like a mediocre action film from the 90's.' The bad guys walk around like video game characters with an AI set on level Easy. I almost shouted in the theater when Eames went Rambo in the snow scene. I understand the decision. Look at The Cell to see how wrong you can go if you explore the subconscious on film. But still, for me his decision to keep the dreamworld neat and clean is a cop out. Dreams don't look like this. Hopes, fears and experiences mix with (the conception of) the real world and you get a pretty original result sometimes. None of this in Inception. Oh right, the architect is in control. How convenient The whole dream within a dream concept was a little far-fetched for me. Have you ever had one? Probably not. So why, when you have a pretty basic dreamworld go with a concept this unreal? The real world does influence the dream the character's have. But they feel it and are conscious that it is the real world. That's a missed opportunity. A dream influenced by factor's unknown to the dreamer could have made it much more enjoyable for the audience.Maybe it's just not my cup of tea. Like Nolan's former projects The Prestige and The Dark Knight: I don't get all the hoopla. Yes, these movies (like Inception) are well made. They are original, have refreshing ideas, are technically good and have decent scripts. But they are not the best of the decade. And this one really is not a 9.2. I'd say a 5.5. Barely... 
 People who are reviewing this as the best movie they have ever seen seriously needs to wake up from their dreams. I don't know who planted this idea in their brain that this is directorial tour-de-force by Nolan but one thing is for sure, Ledger saved Nolan's glutes bigtime. His screen writing technique is feeble; creativity doesn't merely consist of just going berserk with visual treat and showing whatever comes in a ten second unchecked, brainstorming session rather creativity requires constraint. And this movie lacked any constraint whatsoever.If it wasn't for the ultracool visual effects and graphics this movie would be nothing but a vacuous thought bubbles of a person. Whereas Nolan's Dark Knight, instilled by Ledger's genius, was entirely character driven, this movie was entirely fueled by graphical eye-candies. A movie resonates over time when you want to watch certain scenes from it over and over and over again in youtube or your blu-ray disc rented from your local Chinese 99c video store. There were no witty dialogs or any memorable scene in the film that will compel me to stay transfixed in the screen and rewind it over and over and over again.Movies like Vanilla Sky had the same concept yet was made more artfully where the director didn't go overboard with visual scenes while having barely substantial plot.People need to seriously have a reality check. But if majority of the viewers are giving positive reviews, and if you are the only one going against the crowd that surely means there is something "wrong" in your system? Tsk, tsk, tsk what naysayers won't realize is that it would be more comforting to delude oneself and jump on the bandwagon saying it was great film, than admit that they got "jipped" $10.00 for some Sony Vegas type of wizardry. Hey it's the summer after all and it's not "cool" to say things which may otherwise offend your friends! 
 Philosophically it was absurd. Here were the main points I gathered from it: Faith and doubt are discussed, but the conclusion is that having faith doesn't matter because you can't know what's real anyways. What did the Japanese businessman's non-faith avail him or di Caprio's character's faith avail him? They both ended up having the same destiny, no? So, freewill is an illusion, too. Skepticism is the only valid approach to life. Existentialism is true; we really do make life to be whatever we want it to be. Top remains spinning at end, or does it eventually topple? Was it dream or reality? Who knows? Does it matter? No, existentialism says we can define our own reality to our liking. Relativism of truth: i.e., truth is whatever you make it up to be. Subjectivism / idealism / Cartesianism / Kantianism, i.e., ideas are all that are real. If the senses are to be 100% distrusted for determining what is real, we might all be as insane (possessed) as the Dark Knight's Joker. Objective reality, for all practical purposes, does not exist. Every subject just makes up his or her own reality. This leads to solipsism and ultimately a suicidal nihilism. Murder can be justified as long as the person you are killing is someone's "projection." Di Caprio's character snipes men in the snow scene to the architect girl's surprise; he justifies this by saying they are just another man's "projection." Magic potions (i.e., potent drugs) are the solution to anyone's problems.Christopher Nolan should brush-up on some real, Aristotelean-Thomistic philosophy, but then maybe the movie would not have fooled the audience into thinking it is profound instead of absurd. There were good partsthe importance of fatherhood and family, for examplebut they were overshadowed by ambiguity for the sake of ambiguity.Also, artistically, it could've done without most of the car-chase and shooting scenes and confronted more head-on the philosophical issue it was raising, i.e., "What is real? What is being, existence? Etc," rather than hiding its ignorance in a silly plot scheme involving "kicks," "inception," and other Freudian, postmodern rubbish. If it were 1 hour shorter, it would have still been the same: absurdity at its best. 
 Inception no more explores dreams and the human mind than Star Wars explores outer space. Inception is a rip-off of the novel Fireflies in the Shadow of the Sun (FSS), published in 2004 but preceded by a web site on dreams (2001-2009), the thrust of which is about how dream experiences are the source of ideas and other changes to waking life, including personality development. The broader point is that like his character Dom Cobb, Nolan himself steals the ideas he needs to create Inception from a novelist and life long dream researcher.Chapter 7 titled "Journey by Deflection" occurs entirely in a shared dream in which 2 protagonists ascend / descend through "levels of dreaming" in action-oriented sequences and even a "dream within a dream," addressing how intermittent awareness of the dreams affects the dream. But Inception does not (a) intrigue / illuminate as to how these levels are distinct and yet intrinsically related or (b) draw from real dreams and real similarities to waking life. Inception is just an action film set in dream space that neglects the essence of dreaming in dream symbolism. The dream space featured in Inception is fictitious -- a contrivance of both Nolan and of the architect in Nolan's story. Inception would have benefited by emulating FSS in the one way it did not emulate it. In FSS the characters trapped in the shared dream have to solve the dream's logic in order to wake up. This plot is much more conducive to an education of the language of dreams, which FSS author spent an entire lifetime understanding from the time he started a diary of his own dreams at age 13 to his doctoral dissertation at age 27 exploring the relationship between dream experiences, coping strategies, blood chemistry, and symptoms in terminally ill cancer patients. Like FSS however, and this is yet another coincidental similarity between the two works, in Inception the characters are thwarted by a dream that is plugged into their mental efforts to understand it. Also as in FSS, the dreamers have to deal with the denizens of a dream world that react to periodic episodes of lucid awareness of the dream. In FSS, the whole script, including objects and aspects of the environment, respond to the awareness, but in Inception we get the juvenile and scientifically ignorant development that other characters in the dream respond to Dom Cobb and his team like white blood cells to foreign pathogens. The bottom line is that FSS teaches us things about dreams and Inception will impress only the most psychologically unsophisticated among us or those who have never remembered a dream in their life.Also like FSS, Inception makes the point that much of the bizarreness of dreams is attributable to a higher-order thinking. It does this using a statement very similar to one from the former FSS web site, which maintained that while dreaming is a whole brain activity, the conscious person uses only about 3-5% of his or her brain. FSS author remarks that experiencing and trying to make sense of a dream is like trying to fit 100% of something into 3-5% of itself -- there will be distortion!The subject matter notwithstanding, Nolan's storytelling and direction are designed to give artificial weight to the real value of plot twists. In Nolan we have a director who conceals and compensates for second-rate thinking with CGI and high-octane action that detracts from the story without getting the blood flowing. The action in the film was supposed to create a sense of time-sensitive suspense, but came across more like the dull dishwater backing up in my sink than a raging river.There are also inconsistencies in the film. Nolan wants us to invest in the idea that everything that happens in a dream has an effect on the waking life of the dreamer. It works -- until Dom Cobb dismisses out of hand his shooting of all these dream characters like they were throngs of disposable orcs or storm troopers, claiming its OK because they are "merely projections of the subconscious." Suddenly, what happens in dream Vegas stays in dream Vegas. And where did the idea of "limbo" come from -- introduced as a patchwork device for a poorly articulated plot.And much of the film's premise is contradicted by real research which shows that the relationship between perceived and actual dream time is roughly 1:1. 
 I couldn't agree with Kimba more. There is nothing to this film other than the special effects and crappy action sequences. The obvious story line is just as simple as the story in the Matrix and was hijacked form the same philosophy books that have been around for thousands of years.What They Wanted You To See: The special effects are very well done but reminded me of when I was thirteen and learned how to bend corners in photo-shop, for the next three month any picture I created in photo-shop had all the corners bent, I was so excited to show off my newly acquired skill. Same thing with the special effects in this film. How many times do I need to see Gordon- Levitt running, fighting and falling against the walls and ceilings in the hotel room scene? How many times do I have to see the buildings crumble and the van falling in slow motion. I get it, I get it, they figured out how to do this and they are excited to show it off. Great special effects, I would have been in awe regardless of what the plot line was...Just for me the quality of a good movie is one which you enjoyed and would love to see again. Although this movie does inspire some non-independent thinking and conversation; what I am hearing about this film is that many walked out without understanding it, by their own admission, and have no intention of seeing it again. If I saw this movie being played on cable I would flip the channel so fast it would make my TV smoke. But with that said, this will be another cult movie with the same old cult following, bah bah...You Do Not See This Because You Are Not Aware That You Are Dreaming A Dream Within A Dream: Here is the great part. The movie has a secondary plot line. Forget the whole dream idea and whether he is or he is not in a dream and who's dream he is in and why the kids are in the precisely same position, age and outfits in the last scene as they are in DiCaprio's previous recollections. Apparently the character of Leonardo DiCaprio is based on Nolan; the director. The film is about making a movie. DiCaprio is the director, Joseph Gordon-Levitt is the producer, Ellen Page is the screenwriter, Tom Hardy is the actor, Dileep Rao is the technical guy, Ken Watanabe is the money man behind the movie and Cillian Murphy is the audience.Do You Hear The Music?: The whole movie is explaining to the audience and the staff that you must create a semi believable world for the victim, the mark, the audience to be drawn in to. Its about scouting a location, creating a world and getting the audience lost in it, giving the director enough time to plant a non-original idea, such as, "What a great movie this was!" Anyone feel sorry for Cillian Murphy / Robert Fisher, Jr. because he was getting screwed with? well thats not Murphy that was getting screwed with, its all of us!Is Your Inner Ear Intact After All That Imax Noise, Because Here Comes Your Kick: According to DiCaprio's character or Nolan, If you alter the dream world too much, like Ellen Page did in DiCaprio's dream, the victim's/audience's subconscious will turn on you, realizing its fake/ a dream, and will turn on the manipulator of the dream, thus the screenwriter, director, etc. and become disengaged from the film/dream and wake-up, "good afternoon, I am glad to see that you are awake."Do You Remember Any Of It?: Do you remember when the original "Architect" gets killed off in the beginning? Well apparently it is very common in the movie industry to replace/remove the first screen writer. If you watch some of the interviews with DeCaprio he says that he is studying Noal for his character in the film, now you know why.Now, wipe off the morning-glory from your eyes and go outside and play. 
 I was on the verge of leaving the Cinema on this completely ridiculously story. I hung in there (also despite the insanely annoying music) though, and am simply shocked that the film has (currently) a top 3 position of movies ever made. Perhaps I have entered a (bad) dream and have not yet woken up...So the backdrop of the story is basically that a bunch of guys drug people and enter a dream world using a plastic box with wires attached to those entering the dream. In this dream they use the same technique (the box and drugs are now just apart of THIS dream..) to enter another dream. This process can be repeated a number of times - and in the movie they go to the fourth dream-layer. If you are killed while dreaming you will wake up - unless you are too heavily sedated (in real-life, or also in one of the dreams?..), which will then put you in a "limbo" state - which can potentially last for years. If you want to get out of a dream safely - you need to be "kicked" (sharp acceleration) in the dream-layer above the one you are currently in. If you are unsure if you are dreaming or not, you have a "totem" (a physical object that for some unspecified reason behaves differently in a dream - why?) that you can examine.I just hate it. Simply hate it...The only good thing I see in this movie is the ending: DiCaprio sees his kids again - but they look exactly as they have done in his dreams - they have not aged at all. This means that he is still dreaming and he is therefore stuck in a new limbo dream world - and will be there for a LONG time. Phew... that means there won't be a sequel until he wakes up again. Unless it is me that's still dreaming. 
 It is obvious people do enjoy psychological thrillers, virtual reality, and Leonardo DiCaprio. Inception, having it all, will astonish and marvel crowds of cinema goers into thinking they are smart and profound just for getting or liking the movie. I have to say, I admire the movie's performance into tricking its viewers like that; because that's what it is, a trick. A dream within a dream, and doesn't that sound attractive...It is the kind of movie that gets nominated for Oscar just for its crowd pleasing abilities, and Oscars are born within the capitalist world and needs all the capital it can get. Just like Avatar got nominated in the "best movie" category... I've read some review saying Inception could be the movie of the decade; obviously, the guy didn't see that many movies in the last ten years; there are better movies in 2010 only, and a bunch of them.I'm not saying the movie is bad; it's a good movie for its genre; what I didn't like about it is the fuss it created (and that fuss will disappear like it disappeared before for other crowd adored films), but mostly its lack of authenticity, therefore its PRETENTIOUSNESS.This is not a gem - it is a pile of dust in the eyes. 
 This tried to be another matrix - but a) there was already one matrix b) as silly as the matrix is, this is much sillier c) the matrix had some personality, this move has no feel whatsoeverBest example of the lameness would be the "introduction scene" where Dicaprio's character (totally forgettable) shows the young architect the dream world. This scene was totally forgettable compared to the epic action scene between Morpheous and Neo ("Stop trying to hit me and hit me")Also - there is hardly any build up - it goes from 2 layers of dreams to 6, whats the build up? more layers of dreams? Ridiculous. 
 Cobb is a extractor, he enters the minds of powerful people and takes their ideas. Only his latest case is not as simple, instead of taking an idea, he must implant one; however Cobb is a man whose own sub-conscience is in disarray as his dead wife threatens to destroy him.I thought originally when I watched the trailer..."Interesting...But I've seen this somewhere before?"And then as I watched the film it hit me..'Paprika!', Paprika is a anime were a therapist enters the minds of patients to distinguish the problem.I am not saying that the film is a complete copy, because its not...However, the complexity of the film is quite confusing at times, even for a life long sci-fi fan; I guess that was the allure when you consider the many, many positive and glowing reviews. I enjoyed some of the action sequences, but it did not really keep me on the edge of my seat. Cillian Murphy and Ken Wattanbe, were the true stars in my opinion, they played their roles very well, while Leonardo DiCaprio was one dimensional, even though he was supposed to be the most complex and intriguing character in the film. 
 Terrible film. There are way better iterations of dream films than this. Mulholland Dr. by David Lynch is one of them.Like some others have posted around the web, it was too long, and too confusing. Not that there was any depth or cleverness to the film. Too much repetition. They kept 'trying' to explain everything over and over again. It was just a stream of Hollywood trash. Didn't really seem like any of the subjects were dreaming at all. Just explosions and dumb dialogue, with shallow characters and a convoluted storyline.SPOILER ALERT...The film is a film about a man, Leonardo... an Architect, who falls asleep on a plane in first class. It's a long flight to LA, so the movie shows what he is dreaming about during that time that he is asleep on that flight. The only real part of the film is when he wakes up at the end in the plane. He looks around, sees a cabin full of people in first class, then gets off the plane, and goes home with Michael Caine, either his father, grandfather, or caretaker for his two children.The people in first class were in his dream because he saw them in the cabin before he fell asleep. They then each took on a part in his dreaming, but none of them have any connection to his real life. And no, he is not a thief. He is not hired by some black corporation to extract information from people through dreaming. There is nothing of the sort. The movie is just a dream.Supporting evidence:1. First, the movie is just shallow trash. Horrible illustration of a dream film just down to its core. It's so bad that it is obvious how hard they tried to make it look like a dream.2. Reference to Architects... a dream architect is simply what Leonardo is in real life: an Architect.3. Projection... they must have said projection 100 times. It's obvious that the movie is telling you that Leonardo is just projecting his own subconscious onto the others in his dream. This is the only part of the movie that is decent academically. The fact that the filmmakers understand what psychological projection is. But also, the fact that they repeated the concept of projection so many times it just lost its value. Anyway, Leonardo projects his wants, fears, and desires, in a convoluted way, onto the other subjects. For example, "Fischer" takes on his own self in relation to his father. Also, the girl who keeps telling him to move on is another projection of his own mind telling himself to move on from his wife's death...The movie progresses and gets ever more deeper into Leonardo's subconscious, where the root of his anxiety resides. He finally discovers that it is OK for him to be his own man, to be an Architect, and not try to live up to what his father was. So we have a set of problem(s) that reveal themselves ever so slightly as the dream progresses, in the form of Leonardo projecting his fears, etc. onto other subjects, until he goes so deep as to arrive at a place where he has a feeling it is really about him. Like a sort of solution. But like anything, the problems need to be apparent before a solution can be revealed. Dreaming is like this. Your mind weaves together a series of experiences, and projections, and if you understand them enough, you'll know what the problems really are, and you can then begin working on a solution in real life...He then wakes up. Reality is there. It was a cathartic release.4. The dream sharing... there is no literal dream sharing, getting into the minds of others and extracting their thoughts. This is a metaphor... the movie is telling us that there are a group of people in a small area (cabin of a plane) who are all dreaming... and they may have a bit of a spiritual connection to each other... so one person feeling anxious, another may 'feel' this while dreaming and some sort of shared experience results. It's a bit of a play on the idea that people can dream together and sort of experience similar or even the same things. But that's pseudo-science and mostly fiction.5. Recurring nightmare about his wife. Obviously this is another clear marker that it is just a dream. His recurring nightmare about his wife. Looks like she killed herself, perhaps jumped out of a hotel room window because Leonardo didn't show up for their anniversary. Perhaps he was not a good husband and wasn't around enough... he then blamed himself. The girl in the film kept telling him to move on... So Leonardo's major life issues were revealed in a convoluted way within a long dream. Like any human being, those issues are complex. The ending showed how he seemed relieved when he got home to see his kids. It looks like it was a very important dream because it pushed him over a threshold and helped him to realize a set of things to make his life better.Also, can we please stop with all the discussion about the tenability of the things seen in the film? Most of it won't make much sense: it was just a dream. Therefore, defying gravity, ending up in different stages of life so quickly, etc.... it all makes sense when understood from the perspective that: it. was. just. a. dream. Now, after such a lengthy review and explanation, you might be wondering why I only gave it 1 star. I'll end how I started: it's Hollywood trash. Too basic. Too stupid. Too obvious. And to someone how dreams every night, and the fact that there are way better films about dreaming out there, there is nothing to see here... 
 Ten years he did about this story, Christopher Nolan. I hardly understand what is so difficult to understand about this would be intellectual piece of rubbish about a dream within a dream within a dream. This is just what Night M Shyamalan has done in all of his movies. Boring us to death with a boring story for about 9/10th of the movie and then to give us an 'amazing ending', the ending here being that in fact it is not a three layered dream but about a dream within a dream within a dream within a dream so 4 layers, at least that's what my impression is as the spinning thing at the end is the talisman of either the wife or Leonard di Caprio.From the trailer this seemed to be a brilliant movie but I should have been warned by my colleagues from work, one leaving the theater before the ending and all of the others not understanding what the fuss was all about and right they are.Before this year I never believed that Leonardo di Caprio was able to play adult characters (if any at all) after watching Titanic years ago. Now I'm dead sure of it after watching Shutter island and Inception this year.Characters without character so you don't give a damn about them; endless ridiculously action scenes certainly towards the end working to an action climax that is incredibly foreseeable (dream layers ending at the same time); heavy pseudo sophisticated acting that gets on your nerves quickly. In one sentence: the biggest scam since The matrix though the Wachowski brothers are even bigger crooks as they scammed the world three times. What idiots us the public are, are we not? I have no problem with 'amazing ending' movies at least if they would make the effort to give you a story leading up to it. Here there is none.I agree there are really serious bad things to get offended about in the world, but when we feel offended in real life about being conned with situations or a product, we should be too when we are scammed in the movie theater.The 1 point I give for this movie is for the 'street bending' special effect (the other effects being rather tedious and pure special effects for the effect). 
 At one point Cobb tells us that despite his best efforts, he cannot create a dream wife with the depth and complexity of his real wife. Could this be Nolan's own subconscious, commenting on his own limitations as a writer and director?Cobb undertakes to plant an idea in someone's head so that Cobb's employer can monopolize an industry. Cobb succeeds, and thereby recovers his own life. No one in the film questions the morality of this; the film doesn't really question the morality of this, or invite the viewer to do so. Apparently, it's just business. Although in a way that is often thin, banal, or hypocritical, usually the sentiments offered to us in movies managed to stay aligned with basic ideas of good and evil. Not in the case of Inception. The popularity of this movie is a little frightening. 
 But not for me. The movie unmasks itself as a very uninspired convoluted pseudo something when the protagonists have to find an alternative dream-tactic because their target protects himself. What they consider to be a new psychological trick is so plain and unoriginal that becomes clear with a 'kick' that Nolan was absolutely unaware of any scientific profound background by developing the plot. The plot within a plot within a plot is not automatically an "intellectual" challenging procedure when one plot is the exact mirror of the other. The challenge for me was to stay awake whilst the plot stumbles from one hole to the next:How do they get connected so that can dream the same dream? Chemically, physically?? How can they transport their conscious plans into their unconscious dreams and execute them there? Etc., Etc.I can't help it, but Nolan is one of the few directors in Hollywood who can direct any script as tedious as you can imagine. There are so many moments in that movie where i thought Wow, that could have been much more suspenseful if, for instance, Cameron or so had directed it.This movie is stupid. You can make a stupid plot 'intelligent' by nesting it multiple times, it just multiplies its stupidity. In this sense the next Nolan movie could be a even greater "masterpiece" for meat heads: when it has a dump base plot every fool can follow, but this time the plot is the plot in the plot in the plot in the plot in the.....that's challenging isn't it? 
 I cannot understand why this movie is rated so highly, it is infantile in its storyline and soooo boring. My young teen son was raving about it and forced me to go to it, he was very happy that I was there the 2nd time as I was able to wake him up from the total brainwashing of modern movie making Hollywood style. First of all take a very lousy infantile script and dress it up with all kinds of jargon about dreams and subconscious but in fact the story makes no sense at all and has a crude central storyline that is ridiculous - a teenager could make it up. Next take a good smattering of Hollywood A list actors to make it look slick. Get a fantastic stunt crew and great special effects team to make this silly stupid storyline look amazing and keep a bunch of immature easily duped people in their seats for two hours thinking they are watching ground breaking cinema but in fact are watching a story that does not have any substance and a plot that is fit for a 14 year old. Meanwhile the 14 year old mindset believes in the illusion of the picture and gets 'hooked in' with the violence and the extra wow factor of Hollywood over the top visual blackmail. Once I had exposed this trickery to the 14 year old who by the way woke up and saw it for what it was, meaningless tripe, it was worth the entrance fee just for that. Don't waste your time. 
 some people, who liked that movie wrote that we all have to "understand" this movie to find it good and those who didn't, are rating it as awfulDAMN these inception lovers are wrong i understood this AWFUL movie, he (cobb) is a dream extractor who extracts the thought and other stuff of ppl and this time he has to put a thought in.....bla bla bla at the end (which is damn ****) he doesn't wake up from this dream zone(dunno the English word) and i ask myself : where the **** are the bad guys?? ahh there aren't any... what are you freaking kidding me??? its a dream so there is no need for bad guys... BAH i really was disappointed cause i expected some BAD GUYS and some more special effects CAUSE THEY WERE IN A ******* DREAM in other words the move is awful its waste of time and the money in to worth it 
 Seriously? Mesmerizing? Fantastic? Genius? No.I was pretty excited about this film after all the hype, and I feel massively let down. The plot was overly drawn out and repetitive, and there was an over-reliance on action, with massive portions of the plot being taken up by filler scenes of silly shoot-outs and car chases.Christopher Nolan has given this film a superficial sheen of meaningfulness, with the admittedly astounding visuals covering for a plot so full of holes it's almost falling apart. Why are Dom and Mal shown as having grown old and grey together in limbo when they are also shown laying their head on train lines to escape limbo as 30-somethings? Why does the incessant music come to dominate the film, making every scene feel climactic, which is actually detrimental to the final climax? In a similar manner to the way in which the Wachowski brothers took the brilliant writings of Baudrillard and completely mangled them beyond all meaning in The Matrix, Nolan has taken a great idea and turned it into a teenage boy's shoot-em-up action fantasy. People might watch it and think "Wow, that's really deep". No, it's not. It has the appearance of being deep and meaningful when in fact it's just a shallow action film.I'm sure people will read this review and think "she just doesn't get it". The problem is that I do it get. Unfortunately there's just not a lot to get. 
 No, not intellectually: there's tons of thought (or at least editing) going on in this film. But there's no characterization, there's no heart (Leo's one anguished cry of "Jesus, noooo!" isn't "heart," it's badly directed overacting), and, worst of all, there's no morality.I'm an ill-tempered, outspoken, foul-mouthed termagant (that by way of explanation for those about to call me a right-winger, a teabagger, or a prude), but when I watched this thing I was dumbstruck not on an intellectual level (oh, golly gee, we're dream-diving! Like in "The Matrix," only inside brains instead of a mainframe! Wow. Uh, sure.) but on a moral one. See, the film has NO PROTAGONIST. It has criminals, it has those who facilitate those criminals' activities, and it has a victim. That's all.And, yes, I had-- and have-- a real (or is that "real"-- see, I'm of the camp that thinks the whole sorry mess took place in Cobb's bigger mess of a head) problem with that.Almost no one (I would have opted for a plain, sweeping "No one," no "almost," but I recall one review among dozens and dozens that hit on what I'm about to say) seems to see anything wrong with the idea that Cobb and his crew are (ostensibly-- pretermitting for the time being the perpetual argument regarding whether the whole sorry scenario is or isn't a dream) performing an act of mental violation on an innocent man. Why is this? The action isn't that impressive (even the infamous hotel-corridor sequence)-- yes, Nolan does "loud" and "in your face" very well, but the Bond films have been doing more breathtaking and cleanly shot action work for four decades now. (I actually laughed out loud when Cobb and Arthur, decked out in pimp-fashion leather coats and stocking masks, shouted threats at kidnapped Robert Fischer in a dream-warehouse-- not, of course, to be confused with a warehouse of dreams (that might invoke imagination): what, you couldn't just have your goons strong-arm a kidnappee in the "real" world, Nolan? This is as creative as you can get?) We can't just proffer "Cobb must see his kids again at any cost!" as an excuse-- or can we? (I would certainly hope not.) Is it because Fischer is a Caucasian businessman, and therefore intrinsically deserving of attack in this economically volatile era? (The argument that Fischer's business rival Saito is somehow bravely trying to prevent Fischer from forming a monopoly is weak at best: that's what anti-monopoly laws are for, and, by agreeing to attack Fischer on Saito's behalf, Cobb is merely enabling Saito to form a monopoly of his own. And, seriously, inception and/or extraction would be ridiculously iffy forms of espionage. Break into the safe inside my skull, Cobb my boy, and enjoy the five hundred verses of "I'm 'Enry the Eighth, I Am" I've got planted there.) Or is it, possibly worst of all, because Cobb and his goons "kindly" leave Fischer with happy thoughts of his coldhearted father? (From monopolies to psychiatry, then: if Robert Fischer has daddy issues, that's what analysts are for. Cobb and his stampeding creeps are in Fischer's mind to commit a crime; any "resolution" they provide him is a byproduct of that crime, and resoundingly, cruelly false.)We might argue that Cobb and his crew are anti-heroes, but they're not. "The Dirty Dozen" are anti-heroes, criminals and psychopaths nonetheless working for the forces of good by fighting an evil greater than themselves (that evil being the nasty Nazis); Dom Cobb is nothing more than a thief (and, despite the ad copy, not a very good one) perpetrating an insidious act of mental rape against an innocent man (and, by extension, all those who rely on that innocent man's business for their livelihoods). Why all the sympathy for this thug and his crew? What's the catch? When children are involved, or when guilt (real or imagined) is in the mix, are we just supposed to chuck morality out the window...? (The last sad thing, I guess: No one on the team, not even newbie Ariadne-- and, granted, she's likely either a figment of Cobb's imagination, like the story as a whole, or a plant-- questions the "right" of what they're doing. Not only does this make me deeply uncomfortable, it's incredibly shallow writing. An opportunity for character development, tossed. But that's classic Nolan, isn't it? If he can't cover it with an iconic grunt-- "She was lovely," Arthur deadpans to Ariadne, when Ariadne asks what nasty dream-shade Mal was like when she was alive (heck, Arthur, she's still, technically, "lovely"; we were looking for maybe just a touch of explanation here regarding her relationship with Cobb and the team, big boy)-- it doesn't get covered.) Or, in the end, are we just supposed to excuse the immorality of the situation by saying, "Ha! It's all a dream anyway!"? Very much bothered by this, especially since this behemoth has gulped down some one billion dollars in box-office take worldwide....... and that's why I'm giving it two stars. Cillian Murphy looks very nice in his natty suits, and he cries very prettily before Nolan realizes that-- horrors!-- someone is emoting on screen, and jerk-cuts away. Marion Cotillard does her best to squeeze dimensionality from yet another one-d Nolan-woman part; as Mal, she's a sad, psychotic, lovely mess. One star for each of them. As for the rest of it: what a pathetic reflection on values, and what a lousy story. Excellent snow-job, Mr. Nolan, but no star for you. 
 After reading all the amazing reviews and seeing a score of 9.3...3rd best movie of all time, I had to go watch Inception. Also I really like Memento...it was such a cool, original movie..so I was looking forward to this.I went to see this movie last weekend. It was an 11:00pm showing on Sunday night, 3 weeks after opening night and the theatre was packed! We had to sit in the second row...something I don't mind at all.Epic Fail The movie is about corporate (not even government) spies, that enter people's dreams through some unexplained technology. Once in the dream, they trick the victim into giving up his/her secrets. Pretty simple premise, and one that can be taken into many directions (after all we're in dreamland). Well the direction is down the crapper.The whole premise of the movie is so shallow, Saito, a corporate CEO hires Cobb (Leo) to go into another CEO's dream and plant an idea of breaking up his fathers empire (upon his father's death), so that Saito can have a monopoly. How's that for a story?? What a joke.Well the movie starts slow and drags on and on, besides that there are so many plot holes and explaining of everything that happens..like they manipulate the victim by having a dream, within a dream, within a dream. When you are falling in the first dream, the second layer has no gravity, but the third and forth layer has gravity?? WHAAAA??? Also even though you are in a dream, you have no super powers..you use boring guns? How about shooting lighting bolts out your you know what?? BOOORRING.To add to the boredom, Cobb's wife Mal killed herself because she thought she was dreaming. And appears regularly to bore us to death, you get the sense that she's supposed to be evil, but it never pans out.This was interesting on one level only...there was no antagonist. But then again there was no love interest either, and on top of that no danger, cause if you get killed in a dream, all you do is wake up.This movie is amoral tripe with no imagination..eg. you are in a dream world, instead of driving around in a VAN, why not fly? Instead of shooting guns, why not freeze them in their tracks? Also, there are many people (I assume teenagers) who are saying how original this movie is. The Dream within a Dream thing has been done before...it's called "A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 3: Dream Warriors"..also don't EVER compare this tripe to the "Matrix". Matrix was original, it was filled with clever allegory, it was truly awe inspiring, but there was NOTHING clever about Inceptipon.The climax was okay, but just because after 2 hours I couldn't wait to get out of there.Now the anti-climax, is an entirely different animal, like the viewer hasn't been insulted enough...we are left to ponder weather it was "all a dream" (again not very original). The answer is yes, it was all a dream, and Cobb is still in a dream..his kids look exactly the same, even wearing the same clothes as his other dreams.Please do yourself a favour and do not pay to see this garbage. So far the best movie this summer has been Predators...how sad. People think this movie is clever and original because they are teenagers..it probably is clever and original to them, but any adult will find this movie dull and boring. Inception = Fail IMDb for having Inception in your top 3 movies = EPIC FAIL.If I was the credibility Nazi, I'd say to IMDb "NO CREDIBILITY FOR YOU!"2/10 for exploiting a big budget. 
 I'll begin by saying that I have an inbuilt prejudice against films that seem to put cleverness or 'intelligence' ahead of entertainment value. Having read a lot about this film, I wasn't sure whether I would like it, but in fact was very disappointed to end up disliking it as much as I did.For me, the film lacked two essential elements of an entertaining movie - a coherent plot and sympathetic characters. The plot didn't really start to make any sense until about halfway through (far too late) and Leonardo di Caprio as the central character, Cobb, was competent but just didn't have the charisma to carry this kind of story. His wife's death was foreshadowed a lot in the early part of the film and I found I just didn't care how or why she died. None of the other characters came across as real people and their connection to Cobb was generally unclear to me. The impression was of good actors (like Tom Hardy) being basically wasted.I almost switched off the film after the first twenty minutes because its chaotic action seemed designed almost to alienate the viewer. It started to make some sense after that, but was still a long way from what a good film should be. The over-reliance on sudden loud noises (way above the level of the dialogue) in the first half was simply irritating.The film also seemed to have trouble obeying its own internal logic. Several reviewers have mentioned that there was no consistency in what is supposed to happen when a dreamer dies during a dream; I was unimpressed by the 'projections' in the dreams apparently having their own personalities and being capable of independent thought, although the script also had them as nothing more than figments of the dreamer's imagination.Yes, the film's settings and special effects were impressive, but that's really not what an evening out (or in) should be about. If the story and characterisations are lacking, then why bother watching at all? 
 Inception is an interesting movie, however I did not enjoy it. I go the movies to be entertained, to be transported into the movie, to be involved and have my emotions stirred. Inception did none of that, it failed because it focused on the creativity but forgot about the audience. Credit must be given to the special effects, the acting and the creative content, but the praise stops there.I have read a lot of the reviews here and I have to say I'm very surprised, I simply don't agree with the high rating this movie has been awarded with. If you would like to watch an interesting, creative and action packed movie, this will not disappoint. For me, there were too many implausible (bordering on ridiculous) twists to enable me to enjoy it. The technical aspects surrounding the connectivity between the participants was just nonsense, there was little explanation, little offered on how it worked and why. Clearly someone thought the audience would just let that part slide and not be too fussed about the technicalities.This is a selfish movie, its been written, produced and directed to be creative, amazing and intelligent.. the problem is someone forgot about the audience. I for one was not engaged, transported nor were my emotions stirred..apart from feeling annoyed and disappointed.I expected so much more from this movie.. 
 well, well, well, oh hang on, I need another well......crap, crap, crap, and yes another crap......The concept of going in a dream and stealing or planting ideas is probably acceptable, even a dream within a dream is palatable, but hey guys - let's go to the third level and while we're there, let's try for the fourth as well - what a messy, badly scripted piece of junk. This movie is all over the place and whilst you can follow it with the concentration of a chess master, the plot and storyline is weak and rather pathetic. Wasted a lot of time watching this one, so do yourself a favour and go mow the lawn or something ! Save your money and wait for the DVD if you're curious. 
 Before Leonardo DiCaprio agreed to play the lead part in 'Inception', he spent months with Christopher Nolan trying to improve the script. It was at DiCaprio's insistence that the part he was playing, Cobb, the corporate dream extractor, had to have a more beefed up internal arc. Otherwise, Inception would turn out to be another shallow, action adventure thriller. Despite Cobb's triumph over his internal demons (particularly the way in which he expunges his dead wife, who has been haunting him in his subconscious), Inception is much more an exploration of the mechanics of dreaming than a chronicle of emotional catharsis. At the basic level, Inception can be divided into four distinct parts: Intro, Exposition, Journey and Resolution. The Intro consists of the initial scene, a flashback where Cobb must save his employer, a sleazy Japanese businessman, Saito, now far advanced in years, who has been stuck in a limbo-like purgatory for decades, unaware that he was mortally wounded in someone else's dream. It's a nice, little compact scene where we see a near-dead Cobb, washed up on a beach and dragged into Saito's fortress compound. A gun is left on the table in front of Saito and we're trying to figure out whether Saito is going to kill Cobb or himself. Cut to the next scene where Cobb and his associate are involved in a trying to extract information from a much younger Saito inside one of his dreams, as they all sleep on a bullet train somewhere in Japan. Apparently, Saito was expecting the dream extractors and informs them that this is their 'audition'; the extractors' 'architect', the guy in charge of designing the dreamworld, somehow lets things get out of control when a mob of men invade the room where they're all staying, and Saito later has his thugs toss the architect off the roof of a heliport. Despite the botched job, Saito is impressed that Cobb and his partner are able to move through different 'levels' in the dreamworld. Cobb's 'audition' could have been compressed into one or two minutes but Nolan insists on illustrating every aspect of his convoluted plot. We finally arrive at the film's inciting incident: Saito's proposal to Cobb that he enter the dream world of his business rival, Fischer, and plant a suggestion in his subconscious, leading to the dissolution of the rival's entire business empire. 'Inception' is the reverse of what Cobb and his team have been trained to doextracting information and Cobb has doubts about successfully carrying out Saito's proposal. But when Saito promises to pull some strings, enabling Cobb to return to the United States, despite murder charges hanging over his head, Cobb can't resist jumping at the chance to see his two children again.The next part of 'Inception', the 'exposition', takes about an hour. This is where Cobb assembles his new carefully selected "Mission Impossible" superstar team who will penetrate Fischer's mind and plant the suggestion to break up his dying father's business empire. Nolan's explanation of the mechanics of the dreamworld is so complicated, that he has Cobb explain it to his new architect, a naive graduate student who manages to acquit herself rather well despite facing major obstacles inside multiple dreamworlds. Nolan manages to violate a major tenet of screen writing technique: Show don't tell. Unfortunately, during these expository sequences, there's a lot more 'tell' than 'show'. Yes, there is a rather neat scene (reminiscent of an M. C. Escher illustration), where one Paris landscape folds on top of another but most of the visuals are much more mundane: for example, a speeding locomotive appears out of nowhere during a car chase on a Paris street.Much has been written about the 'journey' aspect of 'Inception'. Critics seem to be impressed by the three dreamworlds the 'dream team' penetrates, coupled with the way in which they're able to return to realitythe so-called 'kicks', where a huge sound or explosion propels them through the different levels back up to the surface. Nolan, however, serves up some of the dullest and derivative landscapes that our 'heroes' must navigate throughin fact, these so-called dreams don't look like dreams at all. Take Level 1just a typical shoot em up with faceless bad guys chasing the 'good guys'. As for level 2I felt I was watching a parody of Space Odyssey, with our dreamers floating through a hotel without the benefit of gravity. Finally, I have heard 'Level 3', compared to 'Ice Station Zebra', the schlocky 60s action film set in the Arctic.Inception's Resolution is as unsatisfying as the earlier parts of the film. What are we to make of Cobb? Just because he has made this deal with Saito and it enables him to see his children, does not mitigate the fact that the whole plan to literally change Fischer's mind, is reprehensible. After all, shouldn't have Cobb walked away when Saito had his men murder the first architect? Cobb, by and large, remains a tainted and unsympathetic character, precisely because he looks the other way when he's quite aware that Saito has committed murder.We're also told (by Saito) that the breakup of Fischer's empire is a good thing but should we take his word for it? He's a thug and Nolan has provided us nothing to go on to evaluate the nature of the Fischer empire. Finally, why does Fischer cry at his father's deathbed? He's just learned that his father put his mother in a mental institution so shouldn't he be angry? Or are those tears of joy so that he can be now 'his own man'?The bulk of 'Inception' is merely a pastiche of mediocre action adventure espionage thrillers dating back to the 60s when the genre was in full bloom. The long-winded 'B' story, Cobb's tortured machinations in trying to literally kick his dead wife out of his subconscious mind, merely serves to distract us from the hollowness of the overall plot. 
 Inception is written, produced, and directed by Christopher Nolan. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Dileep Rao, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine. The musical score is by Hans Zimmer and Wally Pfister is the cinematographer. Plot finds DiCaprio playing Dom Cobb, a specialised spy for hire who steals ideas from the dreams of people. But one day he gets a different offer, one that will enable him to see his estranged children. To get his reward he must enact Inception, the planting of an idea in the mind of the selected target. But Inception is thought impossible and should Cobb and his selected team fail? The consequences are unthinkable.There has already been much written and pondered about as regards Inception in the relatively short running time of its life. One can only imagine what will be written and said about it in ten years time. For although it's arguably a bit too early to be talking about it being held in such high regards as the likes of 2001: A Space Odyssey, it's inescapable that Nolan's movie is this current generation's sci-fi classic. That Nolan has managed to make it accessible to the mainstream, and dazzled the eyes as much as the brain in the process, is close to being a piece of genius craftsmanship.Inception is a film that it's better to know nothing about before venturing into it, and then it asks, well Nolan asks, for your undivided attention. It's neither as confusing as some have painted it, nor does it have any tricks-peek behind the curtain type-up its sleeve. The truth is is that Inception has something for everyone; thematically speaking, and that's before we pore over the special effects that sees Nolan raising the bar considerably. As is the case with twisty high concept movies, interpretations are many, with the director rightly abstaining from discourse about his movie. What forms the basis is your basic life and death struggles, with the grey areas during and after given a clever cinematic make over. There's also meditations on grief that this reviewer personally found easy to get involved with; that of course wont work for everyone, but that is just one of many strands that Nolan dangles for the discerning viewer.If that all sounds a bit too serious for the man who has redefined the Super Hero genre, rest assured thrill seekers, Inception is also a loud swirly spectacle. The action is raucous, be it gun fights or zero gravity punch ups, Nolan has not lost the ability to take the viewer on an action fuelled roller-coaster ride, aided superbly by Lee Smith's editing and Pfister's perfectly broad photography While Zimmer's score blends electronic action pulse beats with saddened guitar strains (ex-Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr on 12 string) to craft one of the best scores of 2010. As I said, there's something for everyone here, making it perhaps one of the leading nominees for title of ultimate modern day blockbuster.Then there's the strong ensemble cast, led by a quite scintillating performance from DiCaprio. Following on from his cards played close to his chest turn in Shutter Island, DiCaprio has given 2010 two of its best lead performances. Here he gives real depth of emotion, the kind that makes it easy for the viewers to hang their hats on. His unfussy acting is easy to buy into, giving the character the air of believability, he is the glue that binds the whole film together. Murphy is wonderfully vulnerable, very much an axis in the narrative, while Levitt almost usurps DiCaprio with a neatly layered portrayal that carries a delightful whiff of duality about it. Special praise, too, for Ellen Page. Still in her early 20s, she exudes an intelligent sexiness that shines bright in a role that could have been boorishly played as a cipher in a lesser actress' hands. While Hardy provides brawny levity and Berenger leaves a favourable mark.The Matrix meets Heat and Mission Impossible, only it's written by Phillip K. Dick and Richard Matheson; or something like that. A cracking hybrid movie that's fit to grace any summer and sure to improve and enlighten with further viewings. 9.5/10 
 I'm not even going to waste my time writing a review, it would get lost in the "dream world" of positive reviews. Those who are making this out to be something profound or mind-boggling are also delusional.All it is is a muddy film with tons of plot holes and slightly better-than-average special effects. I am completely amazed at the comments about this being something more than it is. "The Matrix" was far, far better, made far more sense and offered far more insight into human nature, love, etc.Nolan has made a "cluster f__k" that must have subliminally messaging going on in some theaters cuz nobody in our theater enjoyed it very much. The acting is superb. There's one really cool scene of Paris defying gravity. Other than that there is nothing new and there is little or no logical plot line. It is just as my title says, convoluted. I'm a writer and this is the kind of stuff I delete from my novels when I begin to stray or run on.There's one review here that understands what is going on with the people who have fallen for this nightmare... he says "There are movies for stupid people. There are movies for smart people. Then there are movies for people who like to think they're smart." He has hit the proverbial nail on the head. This is a movie a few, likely stoned college fanboys go to see, start a conversation about "what if..." and create something out of nothing. Any intelligent person begins to have serious trouble coming up with answers that truly fit the massive questions in Nolan's script. To pass it off as "well, it's all a dream" is just a cop out. The movie doesn't really work. The dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream is just a way for him to cover his mistakes.This movie deserves a high 7 at best. In time, it will drop considerably on this site... perhaps to near #100. But that will only be due to Nolan fans. True movie buffs will never fall for this fantasy. It's ordinary storytelling and a "make-it-up-as-you-go-along" script.Go back to schools everyone. Stop doing drugs. This is not a fine wine... it is carbonated fruit punch. And your drooling all over your shirt! 
 Inception indeed has all the marks of a bad film. This is not just apparent in the film itself, but comments fan make."If you don't like this movie, it's because you don't get it!" "If you don't like this movie, you lack class!"These sorts of things are the same things I hear when one of my hipster friends gives me a CD of some band nobody's heard of, and when I press Play, I immediately figure out why. When you like a movie that is identifiably bad, you have to come up with excuses for liking it that aren't tomfoolery, like "you just don't get it, MAN. It's too ironic for your puritanical tastes!"In the end, I find that the film itself, fans aside, is not terribly thrilling. The ideas aren't originalit was like a Matrix in the dream world. Except a bad one, because nothing gets explained, really. Watching Inception was like watching the story of Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 play out. The question I kept asking myself was "okay, why is so-and-so doing THAT?" At the end of the movie, I decided that Christopher Nolan, like George Lucas, is talented, but has gotten too full of himself. Why do I care about Cobb's kids, to whom we are granted no real introduction? Why do I care about dueling energy companies? Why do I care about a bunch of corporate hit men and mob bosses? There's no connection.An emotional connection is something lacking, but more frustratingly is the disappearance of character development about 15 minutes in. Everything gets lost at about that point actually. The logic of the plot, the coherence of the plot, everything. It's baffling to me. I loved The Dark Knight and The Prestigethey hit that sweet spot in between baffling and straightforward. Inception missed the mark horribly.SPOILERS DO NOT CROSSBy far, the ending is the most ridiculous. It's a contradictory ending. Although we see the top is clearly falling, and Cobb is not wearing his ring, the children look the same as they did.SPOILERS DO NOT CROSS 
 I sat in disbelief while watching this movie and when it had finnally finnished i registered to IMDb to slate this mess of a movie.i really cant be bothered going into the whole story etc because i'll be here all day.the main downfall of this movie is the Robert Fischer character,his subconscious was trying to defend the so called inception and what did he do? well he just imagined a few soldiers and a train to annoy dicaprio and the rest of the get along gang. BORING!!!! surely his mind could have thought of a few monsters or flying turds or anything other than what goes in normal every day life i mean it was meant to be a dream and uurrrgghhh i cant be arsed going on any more . why was there no drama or excitement to this film? why was this movie not like a dream at all? why did i actually sit thru this movie? why why why? Christopher Nolan and dicaprio i want my 148 minutes of wasted time back 
 A visual Tour De Force that gets lost in its own complex world, Inception stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Dom Cobb; a rogue 'extractor' who steals elements of dreams and sells them to the highest bidder, all in the name of corporate espionage. But things start to go drastically wrong when Cobb takes on a seemingly impossible job and his dead wife turns up to make trouble.Ingenious but convoluted, Inception may not be to everyone's taste  but it is undoubtedly a Chris Nolan picture; the same man who gave us Memento, The Prestige and of course, The Dark Knight. The problem is that for all the slick visuals and clever narrative structures, we end up with something cold, clinical and frustratingly diffuse.Why Inception falters, and I appreciate that I may be in the minority, is that for such a surreal and imaginative concept to work, it requires an equally surreal and imaginative mind, and Nolan is just too conservative and too technical for the content. It might have made a more interesting film had it been directed by P.T Anderson or, dare I say it, Terry Gilliam. 
 I waited patiently to see this in my updated home theater on Blu-ray with anticipation and excitement, mainly based on the high scores given it by IMDb and the knowledge that it had everything; cast, sound, scenery, story, etc. OK, it looked impressive, it was loud enough, but after 2 ½ hours my jaw was on floor in utter amazement at how stupid people can be praising this trash - lemmings. But maybe it's explainable: The ten star reviews here are from those either involved directly in the marketing of this film or 9 year old boys using their parents credentials to praise an adolescent epic or I suppose idiots who swallow tripe and enjoy making recommendations to others about how yummy their tripe tasted. The latter I almost doubt as the intellectually challenged might have difficulty in forming sentences and operating a computer machine so just who are these thousands of reviewers praising theatrical garbage? It absolutely has to be my first guess; Armies of trolls hired by the makers of Crapception.I can't even get myself to offer my reasons for disliking this film as there's nothing to review but I'll try: The repetitive overlapping of scenes seemed more to me like a demo video testing the CGI production equipment. The complete absence of explanation as to how someone can actually share a dream I feel was the biggest hole, and the hole just got deeper and deeper and more deep and then deeper still resulting in probably the most shallow of scripts ever produced for that much money.I typically like DiCaprio but the Cisco girl; Ellen Page was annoying, felt like I had a bad Juno dream during a TV commercial selling conferencing equipment and a horribly dressed adolescent was trapped in my dream spun mind. OK, that last sentence could have come straight from the writers pen of this horrible script.Not all is lost however, a valuable lesson was learned in how I will now use IMDb. I feel I can no longer rely on the score of films here and will, instead, sort reviews by lowest rank and make my viewing decisions from there. My biggest disappointment is the watering down of what once was a great resource for movie choices: IMDb. Since I'm a movie addict I've relied on IMDb since its inception, pun intended, but with Inception's 8.7 score I now see the source data is tainted and the source unreliable. IMDb might be able to fix this by taking measures to identify the reviewers and allow us to sort by them: Kids, adults, trolls, (multiple reviews from a single IP address for example) OK, maybe it's not that easy, the WEB is fraught with mistruths and deception for insipid products and offerings so why would my favorite web site be immune from this condition? I give this film 2 stars for pretty colors and loud noises. 
 Around 750, the renowned poet of the Tang dynasty, Li Po, is supposed to have asked, "Last night I dreamed I was a butterfly. Today, am I a butterfly dreaming I am a man?" Marcus Aurelius, the late Roman emperor and philosopher, wrote, "Life is a dream, a little more coherent than most." Freud concluded that dreams were the fulfillment of unconscious wishes that had managed to sneak past the dozing censor. Aboriginal Australians believed in a real parallel universe called The Dream Time in which everything and everyone who ever existed, still existed, and anybody could enter this place during sleep.Modern psychology believes that dreams are nothing more than random cortical bombardment caused by a lot of activity in sub-cortical structures associated with the filing of memories, and the cortex goes into overdrive trying to make narrative sense of them. Sex dreams are pleasant enough except when the furry little animals show up, but statistics demonstrate that the majority of dreams are truly lousy, the kind we can easily live without. Don't you get tired of running in slow motion through a swamp while being chased by an ogre? Does all this sound like pointless rambling to you? Well, then you're not going to enjoy "Inception" because it meanders at lightning speed all over the place and lives by no rules that human beings have ever known.On the other hand, if you find these adventitious allusions in some way interesting, then you should see this dark and muddled movie. You get a bonus too, because in its style it closely resembles an action movie from the 1980s. Everything is happening all at once -- or maybe not all at once. Who cares? The point is that people get shot in the forehead and buildings comes toppling down for no reason and slow-motion explosions take place at irregular but short intervals.I'm getting pretty tired of seeing films that use some bewildering metaphysical scheme as an excuse to show off still more CGIs. I couldn't watch this thing through. 
 This movie is just disappointing and dreadfully bad. People are victims of the marketing campaign: "this movie is complex, intellectual and multi-layered and if you don't understand it then you are stupid". People don't like to be stupid and having seen that it's written, produced and directed by the same guy who did The Dark Knight they don't think anymore and go to see Inception.So, I will show you that Mr. Nolans movie is the opposition of "complex and intelligent": SUPERFICIAL. I have at least 6 arguments:1. The characters are just silhouettes, transparent and shallow. There is no psychological deepness; the protagonists are emotionless objects moved from place to place like chess figures. They don't have any soul. But what marked a movie is his developing of characters. Sure, you try to create something deep with the relationship between DiCaprio and Cotillard but it's just pathetic, amateurish and stereotypic. And then the kids' back that we see so often that it gets on the viewer's nerves.2. The music by Hans Zimmer is a torture. It's so loud and indifferent that your head is ringing at the end. 3. The dramaturgy is completely neglected. One destruction-scene follows the next; one pursuit-scene follows the next! And the end! What a big disaster: it's like in a video game, in an ego-shooter. It's so stupid. Almost propaganda for war.4. Then, Nolan will make this movie "intelligent and complex". Do you know M. Nolan that intellectual and deep does not mean emotionless and a confusing plot? 5. Nolans idea to enter in the dream of somebody else is not so bad but the idea is not exhausted. Dreams are imagination, there are no rules, and they are bizarre and strange (Have you ever seen a film by David Lynch Mr. Nolan? That is like a dream.). So what all the guys with guns are doing there? Why are there always skyscrapers or a military base? That's stupid. There is NO IMAGINATION, your dreams are copies of real life and they are even WORSE than reality. The only good thing is the sequence with the train.6. To select a well actor like Michael Caine for saying two lines is just embarrassing and disrespectful. Mr. Nolan is capable of making great movies (Memento, The Prestige) but this one is very, very poor.Your movie is not "complex, intelligent and deep" but just superficial and an insult for the reasonably carefully viewer. 
 The film is a disappointment, because it did so little with so much. Basically what you have here is a very interesting sci-fi heist premise; Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are partners who use dream-invasion technology to steal industrial secrets from unsuspecting mass transit passengers (why any powerful people in such a technological age would travel on mass transit, is just one of the many obvious questions the film expects us not to raise) while they doze. In exchange for immunity to a troubling criminal charge against Cobb, they agree to undertake an unprecedented mission: to practice "inception" on a powerful business scion, that is to plant an original idea in his subconscious through the dream manipulation.All of this is great, but unfortunately none of it has any emotional weight. To find that we have to look into the mystery of why Cobb has been in exile, and this plot has to do with his wife (Marion Cotillard) with whom he shared a disastrous and traumatic experience of dream sharing. This is to me where the movie essentially falls apart. It seems like Nolan and the other writers never fully synthesized these two dominant strains in the film, so that most of the time the emotional drama is just getting in the way of the heist film or vice a versa. At no point did it seem to me that the heist was complimenting the drama or vice a versa. And in fact after some very impressive effects sequences during the scenes where Cobb shows his new assistant Ariadne (Ellen Page, too green to hold up her role) a lot of the action becomes outright tedious, never more so than when we're "treated" to about a reel or ten minutes of numbing snow-mobile and gunfight action, right at the point where the film should be reaching a climax. It all starts to feel very obligatory, and Nolan is not a good enough action director to make empty content feel like fun.As a basic action/heist movie with sci-fi premise, it still works well enough that I would recommend it as a rental. Nolan works in some of the elements that have made some of his better films work on a higher level, such as the association with totems and icons (the spinning wheel, etc.) and the connection between memory or memory devices and identity. However when all the pieces are laid out, the film seems overly simple and mechanical. The plot is just this -- the guy takes a job, he does the job, he gets to re-unite with his kids. Although he constantly mopes about in a depression because he tried inception on his wife and she died, he has no ethical or moral problem with doing the same thing to Cillian Murphy's character, even though nobody knows the real consequences that could befall or the true motives of Ken Watanabe's character. I was hoping that some larger picture would emerge, but instead this film is politically naive and instead attempts to be dramatic. The constant shots of adorable children playing on the lawn made me feel I was watching a bad Spielberg film. The entire emotional anchor of the film is put on the shoulders of these cute kiddies in true Spielberg fashion. If you don't buy into this ridiculous soft-target hook, then the whole film collapses like DiCaprio's dream world.This isn't a bad or stupid film, but after a while you start to yearn for at least some human warmth or humor, which is almost always missing from Nolan's films. The characters are so sincere that it starts to become suffocating, especially considering how ridiculous the premise is when taken seriously. Basically this is like "Total Recall" in terms of ideas and in terms of stupid action scenes, except that it takes itself hugely seriously. It does not become a better film by doing so, nor a more intelligent one. 
 Perusing the top 250, I was shocked to see this in the list, never mind so near to the top. I make no apology for admitting, that I fell asleep on numerous occasions (though kept re-winding). This is something I haven't done since Transformers (no re-winding),despite the thundering 5.1 soundtracks. Both these movies are style with no substance, but, back to this one.Has the need to appear intelligent by "loving" this film, so resulted in an "Emporer's new clothes" atmosphere? Can the slip-shod writing and drum-roll, sign-posted direction be so easily forgiven, in lieu of it's unique premise? (nobody mention The Matrix!)I hope this tumbles off the list as time passes, because it devalues some great picks and under-ground, high-points, that have already made it, thanks to some more discerning movie-goers. 
 As long as it remains possible to spend 100 million dollars on making drivel, setting aside 10 million towards advertising in order to tell people that it's great so that they've spent 200 million on tickets before they find out otherwise, there'll be no incentive for Hollywood movie-making ever to improve.I've reviewed Angelina Jolie's latest farrago in very similar terms. While that movie bizarrely assumes that the Cold War still remains of interest to anyone (?), "Inception" insists basically that it's interesting to watch other people's dreams. Well, visually it can be - the "architecture-bending" style of "Inception" would have had great appeal, maybe in a 60-second advert for a credit card or mobile phone company.But visual appeal aside, the "plot" of the movie is not so much multi-layered as multi- pointless. The old cliché that "if you die in dream you wake up" is hauled out here with monotonous regularity, but it's never applied consistently, and even if it were, who cares? If you MUST fire a machine gun at someone in a dream (and I can't think of any reason why you'd really need to), why would you ever run out of bullets? Wouldn't you just dream up some more? If you want to blow up a dream hotel, do you really NEED dream explosives? If the fuse goes out, is it safe to return, or should you always light the dreamy blue touchpaper and stand well back? The movie's makers assume that multi-layering these various dream levels will be endlessly fascinating (as evidenced by the enormous running time), but anyone with an ounce of discernment will simply become less and less connected as the plot becomes "deeper". We're in the same childish, ill-conceived territory here as many movies about existing in "virtual reality" or even "on the holodeck". Simulate as convincingly as you like, but you can't change the laws of physics in the real world, and if you're in a dream, then there's no real need to worry about being stabbed or shot, and neither should the viewer care whether the characters are, or aren't.The urban myth being put about that "Inception" includes some sort of interesting or unexpected ending is no more than that.For a witty, snappy meditation on alternative reality, try Cronenberg's "eXistenZ", and (despite the fact that, like, when you're dreaming you know, your life goes really slowly and, like, you can live a whole lifetime in the dreamy dream state, man) try to give this bloated waste of time a miss. 
 It could possibly be Leonardo DiCaprio. That's a bit harsh  I know he has to eat too  but does he have to always play the same sanctimonious, pedantic, self-righteous know-it-all? And he's been in some bad movies recently. "Revolutionary Road" was a potentially good movie, but he always comes off as immature. "Shutter Island" was so transparent that I guessed the ending about 10 minutes in. But, this is supposed to be about "Inception"...Yes, "Inception", a movie so simplistic that I yawned throughout. My (lucky) wife fell asleep claiming that it wasn't of interest to her. What claimed to be a smart, intelligent thriller, turned out to be the usual bag of guns, explosions, chases, etc. The plot, paper-thin and without any real point, is a yawn-fest of borrowed ideas and takes liberally from movies we've seen before. Is 10 years really soon enough to remake "The Matrix" (with Ellen Page as Neo)? Dennis Quaid in "Dreamscape" is far more entertaining. "Videodrome" is way more complex and intriguing, a movie that makes the viewer work.While the acting is fair enough for an action flick, there isn't much to say about the movie at all. It's pretty 1-dimensional and quite dumb. What really irks me is the fact that I was told repeatedly about how this movie was so complex, complicated, hard to understand, etc. It's really not. It just uses a nonsensical plot device; that of layered dreaming, to try and outwit the audience. While completely ridiculous  isn't a dream within a dream just part of the same dream?  it's also not hard to grasp. Is the bar really that low? What would the audience that this bamboozled make of a movie like "Primer" which is one of the most complex movies ever devised. Even "Mission Impossible" had more plot twists and turns than this drivel.To be honest it was barely just okay. It was boring like a bus-ride through Nebraska. Your mind is the scene of the crime? I didn't see much of any crime - just some folks trying to get a guy to change his mind. Big deal. Michael Caine is even becoming a Director's Trademark. His two minutes on-screen were gratuitous at best, certainly not a requirement to the story.So, to wrap up: boring, simple-minded, dumb, nonsensical plot with no 'science' and barely any 'fiction', less-than-average acting, annoying constant music while people are talking, convenient 'get-outs' when the logic of the story fails, which is frequently. Wow, I actually think I hate this movie. 
 When a liquid is poured into a container, the liquid assumes the container's shape is a well known law of Phsyics. The underlying theme of this movie is Energy production. This story uses one's stages of dream states in individuals. Now comes Inception with its notion that it can change the liquid poured into the container, a chosen human target, thus altering that man's dreams and his consciousness for a desired outcome; A Dream within a Dream at deeper levels and stages of the human mind's dream states. This sums up the production of this nonsense spectacular special effects production, onward with baloney gibberish dialogs! It's ending is as pathetic as anyone could hope for! I felt disappointed with this movie, despite of the enormous efforts that were put into it by this production's Special Effects Unit who had copied and duplicated their special effects from "Men in Black" and from "The Matrix." All in all, this Sci-Fi story is an over publicized ESPIONAGE NONSENSE! I MEAN AN UTTER AND TOTAL NONSENSE!! 
 I purchased this movie on bluray because it was on #6 so I purchased it for 200 Kr which is approximately 38$. I guess I expected a very entertaining movie. but then I began to watch it I was disappointed it was just too slow. I couldn't watch more than halve an hour. Next day I tried to watch it again and made it trough another have hour. I had payed money for it so I wanted to see it. third time I made it through the movie.the theme about dreaming is interesting enough,but they try to long to explain what was going on. Imho it was kind of self explained.I felt nothing for the characters.the plot doesn't get interesting or I didn't get the plot.there is no humour in the movie, they take themselfes to seriously. 
 I do not understand why this movie is so over rated. I seriously thought what in the world is this movie trying to say. Are they saying you can actually control actions in a dream and not only that, you can even collaborate with other people in that dream and better still dream again in a dream and then if you aren't satisfied then dream one more time. Now that's hilarious. They might have proved one thing they are saying which is planting an idea in minds. I think the movie plants and idea that you can dream on whatever you want and looks like they done a good job in that. People actually liked this movie. whao! 
 I must admit I was really looking forward to this film but as with most of the big blockbusters in recent years it was a rather overrated experience. A good cast and some good acting but an overly complicated script and convoluted way of going about stuff using ideas from a lot of decent films that have gone before. The argument that if you don't like it you are too dumb to understand it does not wash as it's easy enough to understand what's going on but why it's going on does not make that much sense. One example is that for no sensible reason Leo is involved in a domestic situation that results in his wife's death and now seems to be worldwide public enemy number one?We have the usual assembling of an elite team to go in and carry out the usual impossible mission with consequences that are unknown to most of the team members that will impact on their success or not. Well that's original.Chucking sci-fi babble into a story does not always enhance the story and most of the inception idea tech talk is boring and nonsensical.The 'shock' ending is predictable and has been signposted since pretty much the start of the film which was overlong and overcomplicated and not at all as intelligent as it was made out to be. Like Shutter Island Leo is once again involved in a film that promises a lot but delivers not a great deal. Some spectacular sets and nice effects cannot cover up an ordinary fun bit of sci-fi nonsense passed off as genius. Like Avatar before it thinking it is some kind of genre changing piece of film when its just a half decent bit of entertainment that will linger with an audience until they get to the car park of KFC.Thought provoking cinema seems destined to be left behind for this kind of multi layered pseudo sci-fi babble which looks pretty but is not as clever as it likes to think. 
 So, it's all a dream.When in high school, I remember one of our English teachers putting a ban on essays that turn out to be a dream. His argument was that one could just write all sorts of nonsense and take the easy way out by revealing at the end that it was a dream.Overlong seemingly pointless car chases and gun battles... Plenty of these in re-runs of the A-Team...All this messing about in the hotel, fighting guards, tying up bodies and moving them around. These guys aren't very creative / resourceful in their dreams, are they? However attractive Marion Cotillard is, the sub plot became very irritating indeed. The grenade launcher should have been used on her early in the dream! As for the end, an easy cop out: it's a dream, folks.I won't go into the cgi / scenery designs. There was stuff just as good in computer games designed for the Amiga and Atari.There was great potential, but this movie is a mess. 
 Inception: the story of corporate agents who trap their mark in an engineered "dream world" that's oddly dreary yet deafening, populated with nasty soulless projections, in which minutes seem like hours or decades, all just to rob the mark - and just when it feels the nightmare's about to end, you just find yourself in a nightmare within the nightmare. This pretty much sums up the audience experience.I found Inception uninteresting, too long, and absolute work to watch. While the premise was great, and the plot at least interesting, the writing, plot sequence, and execution were poor. And even the cinematography was greatly disappointing. You'd think a deliberately constructed dream world would be fantastic - it was merely drear, deafeningly loud, bland, stark, and depressing - even when it was monumental, it had a decidedly Stalinist architectural quality. I realize that people (supposedly) dream in black-n-white ... but did they have to make almost everything grey and dingy? Virtually all of the "fantastic" clips shown in the trailers happen in the first 30 minutes. In the great (70+ minute) finale the only visually interesting and original bit is the 0-gravity fight-scene as the hall tumbles around them.The climax seemed interminable, but ceased to be suspenseful about 10 minutes in. All the supporting cast - with the arguable exception of Caine - were complete ciphers, mere 2-dimensional shadows you couldn't give a damn about. The descent into dream Limbo to rescue their employer made no sense given what was explained about the nature of dream invasions: just whose dream were they entering? It was not DiCaprio's character's, so why are they stuck in his deep subconscious? ... unless of course it was all really just his nightmare to begin with.In the end, the whole movie only makes sense if it really is all the main-character's unending nightmare. Unfortunately, it proved a nightmare for me. I know thousands of brain-dead, hype-fed, viewers who imagine themselves intelligent and deep, felt differently. But my actual nightmares are more interesting, less painful to endure, and considerably cheaper. 
 I was really looking forward to watching this movie after all the positive reviews, the incredibly high IMDb rating and the raving of several friends who had seen it.I will point out that I liked The Matrix, Memento, Batman Begins and the Dark Knight (although this last movie is quite overrated on IMDb). I also understood the plot of Inception from the start and never had any trouble following what was happening so it's not that I didn't "get it".Inception is NOT a great movie and not even a very good one. The plot is not very clever or inventive contrary to what many IMDb raters have suggested and there are no interesting or surprising twists. The characters are poorly developed and, as the viewer, I didn't really care what happened to them. There are no true "bad guys" to root against (all the bad guys are just "bad" dreams) and there is no real desire to see the "good guys" succeed because the object of the entire plot seems irrelevant (implant a thought in some guy's head so he will break up his father's corporation... I kid you not!). The fact that everything happens in dreams removes the sense of danger and risk from all the action and makes it seem like a pointless video game, which is what several of the dreams appear to be anyway... unimaginative and repetitive. Are all Nolan's dreams just "shoot'em up" video games? The attack of the hospital/mountain fortress was as bad as it gets... looked like a CGI sequence from Medal of Honor/Call of Duty.It was also infuriating to me that the rules of the dream universes are inconsistent. Creating an imaginary situation where normal rules don't apply is OK as long as the alternate universe functions according to logical rules, but in this movie the rules are constantly bent to accommodate the needs of the director.A few examples: The top is supposed to be an indication to Mal that she is in "her own dream" if the top spins forever because she has made it that way... If she is in someone else's dream then the top will topple since they don't know that in her dreams the top spins forever. So how does that indicate to Dom/the viewer that he is/is not in a dream/reality in the end scene?... but wow, that is sooo deep.How did finding the top in the safe allow Dom to "incept" Mal with the idea that she was in a dream and needed to return to reality? No explanation... but wow, that is sooo deep.In dream No.1 the van falls off the bridge causing weightlessness in dream No.2 - meaning that non-physical events (it's a dream) of a certain kind(?) carry through between dream layers. In dream No.2 the sleeping characters become weightless but somehow this state does not carry through to layer No.3 and No.4... but it's a dream anyway so who cares if it makes sense?Why do you need a "kick" in each layer to wake up the characters? if weightlessness carries through the layers the "kick" would logically also carry through... If there was some logic to the rule wouldn't it be that only actual physical events in the real world carry through to the dreams? But in your dream you are aware that there is another reality - which is really another dream - so you dream that can feel the effects of the other dream although you are asleep and unaware of what's going on... but wow, that is sooo deep.If a character is asleep in the first layer of a dream he does not know what is happening to him after he has fallen asleep thus would have no reason to dream that he is becoming weightless in layer two as he sleeps through the falling van dream... but wow, that is sooo deep.Since the wake-up "kicks" are supposed to come through sensation in the inner ear and the "kicks" are not real but dreams, then I have to conclude that the inner ear must "dream" that it senses the imaginary kicks, which makes no sense at all... but wow, that is sooo deep. So as you analyze the logic behind the dream rules you must conclude that the entire movie is just a dream (a nightmare) where no logic applies or that the "dream rules" are just nonsense and the whole movie is a pretext for stringing together a bunch of unrelated "cool" action sequences and special effects to make a massive Hollywood "pseudo-intellectual" blockbuster junk movie. This movie was an even the greater disappointment considering that I was anticipating something better than "The Matrix" or "The Sixth Sense". The IMDb rating of 9+ is incomprehensible, this should rate in the 6.0-7.0 range. The rating must reflect a large number of users getting confused and rating it as a video game.As for those who say the number of positive votes/reviews indicate it is a great movie I think you could likewise argue for McDonald's being the best food in the world.I rated it a very harsh 1.0 only to help bring the IMDb rating back to earth. It is however a very mediocre movie. 
 The 150 minutes in the theater seemed like 1500 minutes.Great idea. Good visuals. Horrible production. After all, what was I watching? Whom I liked? Who was the bad guy? Why were things happening on the screen? And, why for so long? That last never-ending sequence on ice. Had no idea who was doing what and why.I did understand the concept as I was prepared for it after hearing from so many people about the 'complex' script. But to me, it was plain stupid. The producers had money and wanted to use it in action sequence and special effects. Did those fit the plot? Not really. This movie didn't need much action, to be honest. The movie should have stimulated our brains, not ear drums.Anyway I went because of the hype. Should have known better. But then, it was a dollar theater and Sunday night when Texas Rangers and Steelers both were losing. So, it was OK. 
 I will start by saying that Inception does indeed have a clever premise, or at least one that sounds good on paper: A group of people who steal information from people's dreams are hired to put an idea in someone's head. Cobb's back story and the way he was haunted by his mental image of his ex-wife was genuinely fascinating. However, all of these nice, fresh ideas are lost in a hurricane of absolutely awful and pretentious storytelling. People have often praised this film for having clever writing, but it strikes me that the film is just deliberately trying to be needlessly complicated to appear smarter than it really is. I say "needlessly" because, when you get right down to it, the overall plot of Inception is not all that complex, so the film just comes across as pretentious.One of the first problems I had with the film is something I thought was present in Christopher Nolan's Batman films to a lesser extent (but those films had the benefit of having straightforward story lines and memorable characters): We are presented to a concept that could never happen in real life. That's not the problem. The problem is that the film delivers its ludicrous plot in such a straight-faced dead serious manner that it breaks my willing suspension of disbelief. In a film that took itself slightly less seriously, I might not wonder as much about where the technology to travel into someone's dreams came from, but here, it just begs for an explanation. If the film weren't trying to have a realistic atmosphere, I might buy that you can do this by injecting chemicals into your arm, then dream up more chemicals to travel into dreams within dreams, but here, it just comes across as absolute nonsense.None of the characters in the film, with the possible exceptions of Cobb, Mal and Fischer, were interesting or memorable in the least. In fact, most of the characters don't really even feel like people as much as they feel like soulless chess pieces that exist only for the purpose of advancing the plot. As a result of this, I could not have cared less about what was happening in the film, and towards the action sequences at the end, I was on the verge of falling asleep. I'm sorry, but watching people with no personalities battling generic gun wielding masses (who, in a stunning lack of originality, are apparently supposed to represent Fischer's subconscious) just isn't entertaining.Bottom line, Inception is a boring, pretentious and rather nonsensical film. It has a nice premise that sounds good on paper, which is why I really expected to like it, but found it a letdown. 
 Dumb! Dumb! Dumb! was that enough DUMS! for you to make you feel sure this is the greatest film of the 21st century, Christpher Nolan's multi-layered visionary masterpiece? No? Dumb! Dumb! Dumb! Come ON! Surely that must be enough DUMS! for you to realise that you're witnessing a tour de force from a director at the pinnacle of his genius? It's a film of transcendent majesty! A mind blowing spectacle utterly thrilling to the senses and deeply fulfilling to the intellect! And if you're not convinced of this, I can do what Christopher Nolan does, and just keep going Dumb! Dumb! Dumb! until you are! It's a trick that seems to have worked on most people as they wander out of the cinema like wide eyed happy zombies, eager to write their adoring review on IMDb and give praise to Christopher Nolan who has now basically attained to them the status of God, but it doesn't work on me. I don't know why, but for some reason the idea that this film is a mesmeric piece of shimmering cinematic brilliance hasn't been 'incepted' into my mind.Actually I do know why. It's because it isn't a mesmeric piece of shimmering cinematic brilliance it's two and a half hours of sheer unadulterated boredom. There's no character development. The drama is unengaging. The action sequences are bizarrely devoid of tension. It's uninvolving. The characters waffle on and I don't care what they're saying. The gunfight sequences are tedious. The enemy characters frequently fire bursts of rounds but never manage to hit anyone despite ample opportunities. How many times does Nolan think it's a great idea to show a character floating around in a hotel corridor while fighting 'projections'? And someone please tell him that he can't prove to the world he's made the best film ever by going Dumb! Dumb! Dumb! over and over again. Except apparently he can.The basic idea has the potential to make the stunning film so many people think it is, but Nolan wastes the opportunity with a dull storyline. Getting a business man to split up his company? Is that the most exciting thing he could think of? Couldn't he get a president to decide to launch a nuclear attack or something? Did it have to be something so mundane? And he weighs down the film with an abundance of under developed material and fails to create any sense of danger in the fights.Why does everyone think this film is SO good? People don't seem to be able to tell the difference between a film that tries to be fantastic but fails, and a film that is fantastic.Good things? yes it's had a lot of money spent on it. There are some striking images. Ellen Page is super pretty...erm... 
 I can't believe this movie is voted #4 best movie, this movie start with such an interesting topic and I truly hoped for a amazing, sophisticated and well executed movie but...,the story could be sublime however the execution is just clumsy, the director tried too hard and wanted the movie to be big. But beside dreams, this movie is nothing but a collage of scenes with major capitol cities; crime involves rich person dying; repetitive, half ass architectural and interior designs, and of course, endless people and car chasing plus everlasting fights..this movie is a combo of many movies, you don't need to see this movie if you have seen some of the followings: 80's James Bonds, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Memento, butterfly effect, Ronin, the day after tomorrow (another really lousy movie)..., the worst thing is many scenes in Inception are quite directly replicated from those movies.the art design of the movie is terrible, I can see the art director only knows M.C. Escher and may consult some mediocre architects, I highly recommend he or she to try some acid or just simply ask people about how their dreams are like.by the way, in the theater seeing this movie, I felt annoyed every time when i see a logo, especially seeing the logo of Hyundai a thousand times, I started thinking about how much money Hyundai endorse and forgot the car chasing is still going on! Also I keep wondering about this: considering 5 minutes equal one hour per layer of a dream, do those people feel thirsty or wanting to go to the bathroom in their 50 year long dreams?For people saying that we should have some imagination to appreciate this movie, I truly believe that these people are just finding excuses for this movie and for themselves too. sorry I just can't stare at a pile of crap and imagine that's filet mignon :p 
 I really do not have anything new to add here. The negative reviews already posted say it all. If you thought this movie was good, you probably did not get it at all. If you know it sucked, then you understood it perfectly well. This was the biggest waste of time since Leonard part 6. Just because you are in a dream in a dream in a dream in a dream, that alone does not in any way make a movie complicated or good. Well crap, it says the review has to be ten lines or more, so here it goes. I have used this website for a long time and this is the first review i have ever done. The reason i felt so compelled in doing so is seeing how highly rated this stupid movie is. If you loved this movie for its "complex storyline," go ahead, turn on spike TV and wait for wwe wrestle mania to come on and write me a gushing 10 star review about the complex storyline and the butt kicking inside a butt kicking inside a butt kicking inside a butt kicking. 
 This movie does not come close to Matrix I. It is sad that this is ranked so highly in the IMDb list.This simply is an action movie. A decent one, maybe, but there are so many movies like this, really. Perhaps one difference is that this movie has some philosophical side to it (albeit junior high school level, "what if all of this is a dream?" type). I wonder why the thousands of viewers who gave a 10 to this movie liked this movie so much. Are those guys all from the UK :) ?! I was also bothered by the multitude of inconsistencies in the movie. For example, the husband and wife spend 50 years in the dream, which means that they must be in a third or higher level dream, which should require according to the movie a heavy chemical that prevents waking up from it in case of death. But they commit suicide and that wakes them up instead of sending them to Limbo, as we are later told in the movie should be the case when that kind of drug is used. As another example, the lack of gravity is felt in the first level of dream, but not in the second level when the van is falling off. 
 This movie was terrible. It tried to be something ground breaking and emotionally challenging, but fell terribly short on all fronts, starting with the basic premise. I am expected to believe that a group of people smart enough to construct an elaborate plot involving breaking into other people's dreams are not smart enough to reunite a man with his family without getting stopped at customs? That's stupid. Fly to Mexico and walk. Or fly the kids to you. This giant plot hole is unfathomably stupid, as is most of the dialogue in this two and a half hour nightmare. I think my personal favorite line in the movie was when DiCaprio's character told his dream wife that he could not do her justice because he could not remember all of her perfections and all of her imperfections. You can't have both stupid. This movie is probably mindblowingly deep and meaningful if your education stopped in grade school, but if you have a least a GED, don't waste your ten bucks. 
 I don't actually consider this to be an awful film but felt that a note of restraint should be applied to the gushing superlatives thus far enjoyed by a film that simply doesn't deserve them.It is a decent story reasonably well told. The direction is intelligent but probably led by the nose by a script that more or less demands sensational action sequences and often contrived drama and emotion.Leonardo DiCaprio coasts through the film with a perfunctory performance which left me caring little about his character. The supporting cast, again, perform well enough but do nothing out of the ordinary.The special effects are spectacular and beautifully choreographed but one can't help feeling that this is why many younger reviewers were seduced so successfully.It is a good film and certainly entertaining but, at times, it was muddled and from time to time one couldn't help thinking, 'why don't they just use hypnosis' or some other suggestive technique. It seemed to be a long way to a short cut.I am perhaps being churlish in that respect since one ought to suspend belief to a degree when watching this sort of simplistic, banal sci fi fairy tale. One reviewer reckoned that this was up there with 'The French Connection' or 'The Godfather'. It is a long, long way short of that. 
 I have been reading nothing but good reviews on Inception these past few weeks, now I knew from the minute I saw the trailer, I had to see this movie but I didn't know what to expect. If you have seen the trailer to this movie, you know that it doesn't explain too much. But I saw Inception today and all I can say is: Wow! With an incredible cast and amazing director, you just can't go wrong. Inception is a movie that not only makes you think but can start a whole conversation with what you just saw on the screen. It's a very clever story that is told with skill and passion, while you do have to pay attention, I loved that it made me think. One of my friends saw a premiere and told me how he would have to see it again to understand it, but I didn't get that when I saw it today. But I would love to see the movie again, I have no problem with that. Between the performances, the story, the sounds, the editing and the incredible effects, I would love to watch this movie over and over again, it's my favorite film of the year so far.Dom Cobb is a skilled thief, the absolute best in the dangerous art of extraction, stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state, when the mind is at its most vulnerable. Cobbs rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible inception. He gathers a group of thieves that will pull this incredible mission off, teaching new comer, Ariadne their amazing world and how to alter it to their liking, but if gone too deep into making the dream into something strange, they could get lost and play limbo between reality and dreams. Even after all the lessons, instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea but to plant one.To write a dream is a riddle, I love the way this movie was written. Christopher Nolan is one of my new favorite directors, he knows exactly how to write and tell a story. The only small flaw, this is a very small complaint, is that his stories while they're incredible, can also be a bit exhausting. This film is a bit long to warn you in advance, it's a little over two and a half hours long. I felt like there were a couple of things with the story that could have been trimmed, but like I said it's such a small complaint because Inception intrigued me so much. To say that this film will be a contender for the Oscars is pretty much a guarantee with the sound, script, editing and effects. Hopefully I think it might be a runner up for best picture.One of the things I hate to do in a review is brag about a movie because I don't want others to get over hyped with the film and to be disappointed when they see it. But honestly, I don't think there isn't one person I wouldn't recommend this movie too. Inception has some of the most incredible effects mixing The Matrix and The Dark Knight, I think the "Zero Gravity" fight scene is one of the most amazing moments I've seen on the big screen. I loved how the story kept you thinking and going, guessing what would happen next and what was going on. A dream within a dream within a dream, you even begin to question with the characters what is a dream and what is reality. With a great cast and excellent director, Inception is everything I wanted and more, once again, Nolan created a masterpiece. Something from his own mind, Inception questions yours' and makes you wonder which world you are part of.10/10 
 Everyone has been telling me how this movie is so complex, so confusing. That you really need to pay attention or you'll get lost.I dosed off in the middle and still knew exactly what was happening.This movie is nothing but a cross between The Matix, Dreamscape, Mission Impossible and about 3 other movies and anime films that have been coming out since the mid 1980's. The ending was the most obvious outcome it could be, you already know he doesn't except the dream version of his wife so she would be gone. But the kidsgetting home to see their faces again, they were the real focus. If you missed that in the beginning then seeing his father-in-law pick him up at the airport should have been the final tip off.Most people I ask about that missed it all; they couldn't even tell which dream was which. I think that's what scares me the most, people think this takes real intelligence to follow.Maybe if your attention deficitOh wait I am and I still had no trouble following this over rated boring movie.I gave this movie 4 out of 10 stars for special effects only, for story line and acting I give it only 2 stars 
 Well, I have to agree with this site, which came up when I was searching for Inception: "Inception' wins informal poll as most overrated movie of 2010." I just don't get it. This is what I saw (fortunately for only $4.99 on On Demand):- Great special effects, but mostly in the beginning of the movie. - An interesting psychological plot about manipulating a guy's mind. - An incredibly long middle sequence where one guy is moving around unconscious bodies, interspersed with equally incredibly boring scenes of shooting and fighting on a mountain - why in the world was all that necessary? Without the hour or more spent on this totally unnecessary footage, it would be have been a much better movie. We almost killed ourselves when they showed the first shot of the van and it had JUST started falling. I guess the director took the idea of 5 minutes real time/1 hour dream time painfully literally. - A plot with a guy and his wife that is (SPOILER ALERT) totally predictable if you saw Shutter Island or Memento, or took Psych 101. - A cast that acted reasonably well, but whose characters I didn't care at all about.So I don't get why it's so popular. I think I would have liked it a lot more if it had been ruthlessly edited down to an hour and a half, and if the wife plot had been something different for a change. I'm getting tired of that one.I know I'll get a lot of screaming comments from fans who don't believe anyone should have a different opinion than they do, but I'd like to see anyone justify that long middle sequence. 
 "The Emperor's New Clothes" is a short tale by Hans Christian Andersen about two weavers who promise an Emperor a new suit of clothes that are invisible to those unfit for their positions, stupid, or incompetent. When the Emperor parades before his subjects in his new clothes, a child cries out, "But he isn't wearing anything at all!" Personally, I find this movie an utter waste of time and recourses.Am I the child in the above-mentioned tale? Am I not intellectual enough to understand this marvelous gem: Inception? Or perhaps the majority of the users on this forum are scared of submitting negative reviews, for they might be regarded by others as stupid for not being able to comprehend the intellectualism in this movie.PS: I watched this movie in two parts (for it is long and boring) and I managed to fell asleep on both occasions. 
 A competent movie that somehow has gotten a ridiculous amount of praise. I felt just about everything in this movie was average, but I am sick of being berated for refusing to say this movie is anything less than perfect. A decent premise, well acted, but long and slow. Unfortunately this movie is riddled with mistakes and the subplot with the wife could have been so much more interesting than her barely getting a look in. Some good moments, but not enough to make it as long as it was for me.Also, was it just me, or were the kids the same age at the end of film? If so then doesn't this mean that the is he in a dream or not ending (which I saw coming as soon as they introduced the spinning top by the way) is pointless as if the kids haven't aged, it must be a dream.Don't believe the hype! 
 The movie is a cascade of factual errors and logical errors. The very foundation of the movie is so totally wrong and mistaken, that the movie makes no sense at all.Nolan should have done some research on "Lucid Dreaming" to get his facts straight. Reading only one book would have sufficed (Lucid Dreaming, by Steven Laberge).Were other movies brilliantly succeed (Dreamscape, Matrix, Existenz and possibly others), Inception miserably fails...For people who know very little about dreaming, this movie may seem great, but for those who do, this movie is a joke. Really too bad, I just can't understand how writers / directors can totally ruin potentially great ideas and concepts. 
 The important thing to start out with is to distance yourself from the hype about this film because it will not help you when watching it, nor is any of it totally justified. It seems that any mainstream film (especially at summertime) that manages to at least do something different or clever will be hailed as a masterpiece simply because it is not Transformers 2. So watching it expecting to be amazed is probably the wrong state of mind to be in. Likewise it is probably not great to be expecting something impossible to follow, because again the film is very clearly constructed and even when action is occurring across several "levels" at once, I still found it easy to follow.The film is a thriller and, like many great thrillers it is one that is built on an imaginative and clever concept. The world of dream infiltration is well constructed and is also well delivered to the audience; some people near me were muttering and asking confused questions throughout, but personally I found it easy to follow for the most part  and not because I'm smart but because the film does a good job of bringing the viewer into the ideas and concept. In terms of being an action movie, the second half of the film does pick this up well and the race against time across all of the dream levels, with the editing bringing it all together well so that you don't lose what is happening and indeed the movement of time and the importance of the relative events are clearly understood to produce tension. Although the dream worlds are a bit too "ordinary" at times (most of our dreams are filled with things that don't make any sense or have echoes of things, rather than detailed cityscapes and gun battles) there is creativity in the visual design and in particular a Matrix-esquire battle in a spinning corridor is thrilling to watch.To its credit the stepping up of the action aspect does not mean that the ideas that got us here are abandoned because they are not. The importance of Cobb's subconscious and in particular his own gnawing guilt over the death of his wife initially appears to be just a way of having a repeatable "baddie" turning up in various places throughout the film, but actually she is well used to introduce doubt and alternative interpretations to the film. As everywhere else, the ending of the film was met with groans that there would not a confirmation of the ending. Personally I think that "was the real level actually a dream" is just an idea planted by the director to keep the audience from simply finishing the film and walking away from it and that the presented reality was actual reality. I can understand why some have disliked this because it could appear like Nolan is going "or was it?" without providing much more than the question, but I choose to see this as just another tease, which he is perfectly allowed to do since the whole film is about trying to get others to doubt their reality and change their own minds by themselves (although not really).The cast deliver well. DiCaprio manages to produce an engaging character who emotionally makes sense and it is his performance that helps the deeper material in his subconscious work well and be more accessible to the viewer. Gordon-Levitt is memorable for his action scenes but he is also a good presence generally even if he has a lot less to do. Page provides the viewer with someone to "come in" with and she works that angle well. Hardy, Watanabe and Rao round out the team well. Some of the bigger names had the potential to be distractions by virtue of "oh look its x" but Caine, Berenger, Haas and Postlethwaite didn't really do that even if their actual screen times were minimal compared to the recognisability of their faces. Cotillard works very well to have her character vary across levels and contexts and I liked her better than I thought I would.I'm not in agreement that Inception is a classic perfect film but it is a very good one. If anything the elevation of this film is more to do with how average and uninspiring the vast majority of films released are, but I suppose that the success of this one is a good thing in some ways to maybe counter that. The concept and ideas are well constructed and presented to the audience and the film itself is not hard to follow but does challenge the viewer to do the one thing that a blockbuster normally doesn't  pay attention. Doesn't quite live up to the hype but it is still a very good and engaging film. 
 This is ,unfortunately, a cinematic catastrophe, and all my expectations that I might have had before like this being the most original film of the year that might open a new page in the sci-fi genre, proved completely and utterly misconceived, to say the least. This is simply the most overrated film after Nolan's Dark Knight, supposedly intended to represent a pinnacle of intellectualism, originality, and ideas never before even hinted at. But, all in all, this is nothing but two and a half hours of utter and sheer nonsense, a real viewing terror, a debasement of a genre! It is in the limitless realm of quasi-Freudian, or is it Yungian ?, philosophy, e.g., a dream fixing, and the main actors are faced with a difficult task of deciphering the way to create the dream within the dream within the dream, and when you expect to see some true scary Freudian elements or dream symbolisms of destruction and, God Forbid, sex, no, you are left in the cold with your feet dangling in the aforementioned 'within loops', as sexuality, as we all know, is the source of all the modern evils, and as this film is intended for all and sundry, e.g. like a pleasant, 'wellness ' relaxation after a really exhausting 3-hour shopping spree, the family must let some steam off in the nearby cinema, and ,voila, Inception is here with a correctly calibrated dose of illogical shooting and explosions ( at least I got to see the technology and weapons the Alpine units today use ), and ,yes, not only DiCaprio survives , everybody else fares the same, so have no fear, Nolan is here! But, the damn time, it just won't follow the film's logic, 140 minutes is a heck of a time to kill the boiling fury over this total waste of money, time and personal dignity. Thank God for Star Wars, Star Trek, Alien series and a million other films. Crisis in the screenplay department has really surpassed the worst personal expectations, now even the illiterate are writing  Just horrible  
 Where to begin? Well,the soundtrack is unnecessarily loud, noisy and repetitious and consequently extremely irritating!!!!!!!!! How many times can you crank the big violin sound up? hOW MANY EXCLAMATION POINTS DO YOU NEED? hIT ME OVER THE HEAD SOME MORE!!! pLEASE!!!! I felt it didn't sync with the film at all. God help those folks whose neighbors have surround sound and play this at even normal volume. After 30 minutes of this I'm ready to #*&%#$%%.With regard to the film itself, it's the same 15 minutes of plot over and over and over until you want to throw up! I "got it" after the first 30 minutes but apparently this director believes his audience is comprised of morons who enjoy spending 2 1/2 hours watching pointless gun battles and cars crashing. And it appears that his conclusion may be true based on the gushing praise for this over-hyped grade "C" movie. Little of this "special effects" activity advances the film in a significant way. How boorish! By far one of the worst acclaimed films I've ever seen. I'd rather go to the dentist than sit through this. My biggest regret is I can never regain the time I spent on this utterly silly piece of #$@&*^%*. 
 The reviews that call this "genius" are just ridiculous. The plot was so overwhelmingly incredulous that even the most open minded movie goer would find this plain brain dead.I love the long mundane reviews of this "work of art"/"masterpiece". How much were you fools paid to write such garbage.Half through my son summed it up best when he asked "dad, is it almost done yet?" Enough said.3 thumbs down from our group and 8 thumbs down from co-workers.Odd, my own little cross section severely diverges from the reviews in IMDb......hmmmm.. 
 People must have gone insane!!! I usually don't give my opinion in blogs, forums etc. because it makes me feel like a dog barking in the dark at unknown strangers. And I don't like this registration forms and surveys and other marketing bullshit tools that sites like this are using. But... this film and its absurd rating provoked me so much that I had to brake my principles. I have seen A LOT of movies. Thousands of movies. And I(please forgive my lack of modesty)consider my self an intelligent person. At least a little bit over the average level. And I am mad at this movie and at the 99% of all these people that with their votes made me believe that this movie deserves 148 minutes of my life. No it doesn't deserve even these 50 which I generously gave it... Despite of all its "layers", special effects, computer graphics and multimillion dollar budget, this movie is simply a flat, pointless, boring and not even entertaining bullshit. It insults me, because it's made for elementary school kids, uses their language, verbally explains every step like in the mute films of the twenties, and pretends to be a high class entertainment for smart people. Yesterday I watched 4 or 5 European and South American movies. None of them had budget higher than 15 million dollars. Inception doesn't worth even a tenth of the worst of them with its 160 million dollar budget. Apart from the special effects I don't see anything good in it. Acting is bad, dialogue is worse, and entertainment is zero. I was actually forcing myself watching and waiting to see the point of all this... Couldn't bear anymore when my watch showed that 50 minutes have passed. And I love Science Fiction movies. I even from time to time enjoy watching a B rate movies, which make you relax and give you 2 hours of entertainment away from everyday stress. This one just made me checking my watch every 2 minutes to see when it would finally end... Basta!!!Don't waste your time and money! 
 I don't get all the positive reviews for this movie. I found it overlong and I could not find a reason to care about any of the characters. Technically speaking, there was no true heroic character, as it was a bunch of technologically-advanced criminals and their victims. At several points during the movie I was pleading "Go home! Go home!" It had a decent idea but I have to think that Rod Serling (RIP) probably could have done a much better job with this and he would have done it in a shorter time. I really think the writers and producers could have made a tighter film with better and more interesting characters. Christopher Nolan did terrific, terrific work with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, but this film is unworthy of its success. 
 The title pretty much sums the movie up. An absolutely amazing cast and incredible premise was almost wholly pushed to the margin by special effects and "action". My hopes were too high. Nolan was clearly out of his depth as far as intellect goes and totally blew the chance to pull off an epic, unprecedented dream heist flick.Dear Nolan, if you're reading this: You can give guns, grenade launchers and C4 to a cast of unknown actors, place them virtually anywhere and have them destroy everything in sight for two hours, and it would have been just as good as this movie.Thanks for ripping me off by luring me in with an allure that promised slick corporate spies engaged in mind games in surreal settings and instead taking it from a promising half-way point into a senseless visceral joyride that was quite literally the cinematic equivalent of van Gogh painting Starry Night then taking a bowie to it and slashing it to ribbons before the paint has a chance to dry.It's painfully clear that you wrote the script to allow you to stroke your ego with the most over-the-top action flick you could cook up. With the money you spent on all the great actors you employed for this, you could have hired a dozen great writers to develop a script that would have actually been worthy of their talent. You sir, simply WASTED it. I actually feel embarrassed for Michael Caine. That such a fine actor was dragged into this crap is sad. You could have just flashed a still photograph of his face for a few frames and it would have sufficed since you don't pause for even a second to develop ANY of the characters except for Cobb and anyone with half a brain was probably wondering WHY character development was so scant in a film that deals so heavily with the subconscious mind. No, I guess a car chase was more important. It's entirely beyond me why you tainted your ego-stroking action flick with a genuinely thought-provoking premise when all the "smart parts" flew over the heads of your target audience by a wide berth.tl;dr version: shallow, pseudointellectualist excuse for making an obscene, self-gratifying action flick. I hope to god you get your money's worth if you actually pay to see this garbage. 
 I could explain the devices that drive the action, but that would take away the jobs of all the archetypes in the film who's job it is to endlessly spout exposition that will explain the nonsensical and unaffecting action you see on the screen.If you think one level of action clichés is enough to rot your brain to a sub-100 IQ level, imagine SEVERAL levels of action clichés, all explained for you in a "hey this isn't very interesting but we've created a world and have to explain it so we can get back to the gunfights in a dreamworld".I'd probably put this down as one of the most empty viewing experiences I've ever had in my 40 years of movie-going. I want my money and 120 minutes (I left early) back. 
 Contrary to the opinions of the deluded army of comic reading Nolan fanboy geeks who have descended on IMDb, Christopher Nolan has entirely and irrevocably disappeared up his own self inflated backside with this movie. I say The Emperors New Clothes because the director will sneer at anyone who doesn't understand the film and he has thus created a perfect defence mechanism. I'm sure Di Caprio et al had in depth briefings about the narrative and can explain it verbatim but us viewers are left to work it out for ourselves. And it's so full of holes, so full of irrelevant tripe and so full of itself that it isn't easy. It's incredible that its been voted the 3rd best film of all time by IMDb users. I mean seriously, that's a joke. The fanboys all want to laud Nolan as the new Kubrick (another joke) but in doing so they have voted this tosh above ALL of Kubricks work. It's such a smug self congratulatory film from the get go and it just gets smugger as time drags on.Now of course I appreciate that you can go too far in explaining every detail to the viewer with unnecessary script mechanics that insult the viewers intelligence. However, although you can go too far in explaining, you can also go too far in NOT explaining and expect the viewer to grasp in a single viewing what is a massively complex concept film - and one that's so badly flawed in so many areas for it to undermine the whole 'intellectual' nature of it. The idea of the film is OK and the film does have its moments but there are so many scenes that don't make sense that it spoils it entirely. I appreciate that 'heist' movies are usually procedural and that Nolan wanted to avoid that but in doing so he's created the most self-indulgent picture ever.I could go on about the snow scene, the thoroughly implausible way these people not only do what they do but 'assemble' as a team, the oh-I'm-Christoper-so-considerably-cleverer-than-you-are-Nolan backstory with Di Caprio's wife but I'm not going to pick apart the scenes because I'd be here for hours and I haven't got the energy left after enduring this nonsense. Besides; everything could be spun that he meant this or that (he isn't as deep as he likes you to think). Inception is all fur coat and no knickers. It explains so little of what is going on that I left feeling angry. And I generally get these films so it's not a case of me being some moronic fool who struggles to follow the weather. And billed as a completely original idea? Nah. There's obvious similarities with The Matrix, Dreamscape, Total Recall, Flatliners, Vanilla Sky, Pan's Labyrinth, Dream Demon and even one of the Star Trek Next Generation Episodes centred around the holodeck, all of which I've 'gotten' - the good ones, the bad ones, the ones you ponder for days afterwards. The fact is with this abomination I simply can't be bothered to think about it because I really don't care. I don't care about the characters, I don't care about the ending (which was excruciatingly predictable) and I don't care about how clever Nolan thinks he is. You're not mate. You've pulled a massive con with this film by creating a movie where you can call people stupid if they don't get it / like it. You get to sneer and snigger at the stupid little people. You've taken your previous successes to the movie execs and they've foolishly allowed themselves to fund your rampant self indulgence. That's what irritates me the most about this utter piffle. I understood what was understandable about this film and there are of course films where the intention is to purposely let the viewer fill in the gaps with their own imagination (generally a nice touch) but that simply isn't the case here. The story script and indeed most of the awful acting (outside of Di Caprio, Juno girl and Cillian Murphy) neither holds it together nor papers over the cracks of a weak script that's trying to be oh so deep... and badly failing.This is over 120 minutes of my life that I will never ever get back and I simply couldn't wait for the film to end. I had lost all interest in any of the characters, their backstorys or indeed the 'mission' after an hour once I woke up to the fact that he was clearly unable to pull the film together into something coherent and genuinely contemplative. And judging by the rest of the audience and the people I was with, I wasn't the only person who left feeling bitterly cheated. I congratulate Nolan on creating hysteria, mass hypnosis and hype because he's clearly managed to brainwash a lot of the audience into making them think they've seen a clever film. That's the only inception.Go and see this insidious fluff for a visual experience perhaps (even then; visually it's pretty overrated). But don't be surprised if you feel a strange peer group pressure to tell whoever you go to see it with that you understood it all when you probably didn't (or if you did; that you actually care and did so in spite of a dumb script).Nolan is not nor ever will be Kubrick. Kubrick would have done this film justice - after he had rewritten the script, changed half the cast, removed 45 minutes of length and replaced it with sensible content that made the film engaging and cohesive. I fear the next set of people to be duped will be those who vote for this trite idiocy come the Oscars.BTW I wager that Nolan watched Guy Ritchies Revolver and liked it. Congratulations Christopher, you have just descended to his level of filmmaking.Meh. 
 Based on reviews I was hoping this was a "different" American film in the sense that it will have substance, subtlety and that it will make me think. It did not, it did not and it did not again. It is your typical Hollywood flick with car chases, shooting galore, explosions, fistfights, pretty boys and girls - the whole nine yards to sell tickets to the ADHD generation of teenagers. I gave it 3 stars - instead of just 2 - because the special effects are absolutely astonishing. This film wishes to be clever but really is not and does not make a lot of sense either. It reminded me of the teachers/professors who were confusing on purpose in order to make us believe they are smarter than we were. 
 This had a lot of talented actors and some nice visual effects. Sadly I could not get into the story this movie was trying to convey. Just didn't make sense to me.Leonardo has been in two flops that I just saw within a year and the other is Shutter Island.. I wouldn't waste your time trying to watch either of these movies. In closing I always like to see Ken Watanabe.Some movies that were similar to this that I really liked were the Matrix and The Fountain. This movie is nowhere near the caliber of those movies and I find it hard to compare this movie to anything, but way - WAY over rated. I really liked the movies Knight and Day with Tom Cruise and recommend that and also Resident Evil : Afterlife with Milla Jovovich. 
 **Only a very teeny spoiler** Well, what can I say? Inception was the most overrated movie I've seen in years. The plot had more holes than a string vest.I found the first 20 mins dull at best, and was easily distracted (I actually paused the film and ordered a pizza/had a look at Twitter/read another message board...). I even restarted the film to give it another chance, but to no avail.Then for a whole 20 mins, it managed to keep my attention before leaving me again thinking 'why I am watching this?' for the next hour or so. I finally gave in with 45 mins to go when it turned into a Bond movie with snow skiing chases that appeared from nowhere.I didn't give a toss about the characters who did nothing to make me want to care, the plot didn't fill more than a few minutes of the 145 mins I stayed with it and bar a few nice CGI tricks - I can't say there was anything not done better in other movies many times over and in a great deal less time.Give me Total Recall for dream based plots and action any day of the week.The acting was average, the architect looked 17yrs old yet somehow became an instant expert in dreams/psychology and managed to be smug - was she the token precocious child that all writers include when their stories are dying on the page? Perhaps a cute pet dog would have helped here.It isn't often that I switch a film off because I think its pointless to carry on. Inception didn't even annoy me enough to see what happened at the end - I simply didn't care. How this is getting anything over a 6/10 is beyond me. I gave it a 4/10 and even then I think I'm being generous - it didn't even score on the So Bad It's Good chart. 
 Inception - I saw this a while ago. I only write about it, because South Park was making fun of it last night. I never got the enthusiasm for this flick. It was somewhat entertaining, although, certainly not mind blowing or even that inventive. I've seen more mind bending things on the Outer Limits from the 60's. It was not memorable. In fact, I had forgotten about it until last night. One of the things I remember was how poorly Ellen Page's character was rounded out. I remember laughing, not at her - but at the part she had to play, Ms. Exposition. Explain everything to her, so the audience knows what is going on. The action was cliché, and left me wanting more. The whole thing about going into someone's dream is so silly, but not funny silly - which leads me to...South Park, on the other hand. Was a lot more fun. Throw in a Sheep Herder, a young Mr. Mackey, a random pizza delivery guy, and even a retired Freddy Kruger and you've got an entertaining 22 minutes. And, of course, Randy Marsh. Stan is trapped in Mr. Mackey's dream, so Randy goes in to save him. Stan sees his dad in the dream. But his dad has come into the dream as a Butterfly. Stan says "Did you come here to help me?" and Randy replies "I was gonna...Butterflies have no concern for these things, Stan. I'm gonna go find me some butterfly poon." So much better than watching inception.
