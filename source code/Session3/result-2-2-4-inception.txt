 Usually try careful hyping film , setting expectation high , film geek guilty , however Christopher Nolan 's Inception , really possible.This possibly one perfect film ever seen . absolutely confident every way , something extremely refreshing , even Avatar . Christopher Nolan get slack making great look ultimately heartless affair , one agree , however think anyone argue . emotional aspect film tie together really centre film , focus . want simplify film , simply calling Kubrick Bond , Gondry huge budget , sure called far , something think Kubrick could ever made . pure Nolan , pure greatness.I hate writing something pure fan-boy gushing , really difficult . find thing like , sure maybe saw second time , maybe would find something n't like , first time . way cut , mean always action screen , , visuals interesting enough keep eye glued.The final hour film , possibly one complicated action sequence put film . constantly paying attention remember layer happening . Without spoiling anything , say film , make film great , layer . seen talking about.All actor fantastic , Di Caprio stand . Yes , probably due fact star given emotional weight , handle perfectly , similarly performance Shutter Island . Ellen Page , usually hate , give great performance . Tom Hardy give break performance , quite bad ass.I hope audience ready film like , pure auteur driven film sacrifice single frame studio . would hope film change Hollywood , 100 percent director vision yet definitely marketable film , much like District 9 , yet think . recommend film anymore , say everyone anyone see . Sorry gushing , hard too.If liked review check new film blog : http : //thedeletedscene.wordpress.com
 Films dream subconscious usually straightforward almost always weird . `` Inception '' exception rule , like cinematic predecessor explored contrast question real illusion ( i.e . `` Matrix '' ( 1999 ) , `` Cell '' ( 2000 ) , `` Abre Los Ojos '' ( 1997 ) & American remake `` Vanilla Sky '' ( 2001 ) ) , really ca n't look away , . `` Inception '' excellent breathtaking movie may one film released far Summer 2010 life hype . nearly perfect highly original film hold attention credit roll . le know movie going , entranced seeing it.Leonardo DiCaprio play Dom Cobb , world class criminal , help team sleep expert , work way people 's subconscious steal people value : idea directly mind . last assignment possibly clear name , assigned steal idea someone , plant one inside person 's mind . difficulty come certain people trained block idea taken.That plot summary cover basic pretty complicated story , describe every plot detail would take away magic film must see believe . DiCaprio good role , unlike many film starred , perhaps role character alone carry weight movie shoulder share equally one co-star . Instead , great ensemble cast team together make movie work , character collaborate pull unique heist . Joseph Gordon-Levitt , Ellen Page , Tom Hardy especially good roles.The special effect film also good , amazing considering simplicity compared `` Matrix '' movie . slow-motion shot , impossible kung fu fighting sequence . 's especially interesting film get architecture certain dream , impossible sequence filmed way 've never seen drawings.However , special effect would mean nothing story n't good . reason , even something simple spinning top hold attention way would never think would seeing film . credit given writer director Christopher Nolan , made bad film yet . many twist turn film , Nolan never loses focus process telling story . Nolan get nominated Best Director and/or Best Original Screenplay next Oscar season , something terribly wrong Academy.That said , still lot film still n't get , may require multiple viewing better understand . However , best film 've seen confusing first . `` 2001 : Space Odyssey '' ( 1968 ) film 've seen couple time , still n't understand completely . still major following , though , 'm positive movie . 's incredibly entertaining movie , also make think continues leave theater .
 saw Memento recently , something turned great miss.I saw , make couple thins straight-and 'll definitely Inception.Christopher Nolan keep improving , even complex multilayer script like this.And thought Memento hard reach viewer , no.Inception keep mesmerized captivated genius , 's hidden behind it.And director screenwriter ( words-Nolan ) , acting sound-and effect editing well.When cast like this-i mean Leonardo DiCaprio , Joseph Gordon-Lewitt , Michael Caine , Marion Cotillard ( personal favourite ) , movie keep going flawlessly.Most crew Nolan brother worked TDK earlier Batman Begins.So Oscar noms category certainty me.The thing one could movie , headache one could have.See , friend go movie brainless action , enjoyed Iron Man 2 A-Team , movie-you see least twice , understand it.The level layer thing happening many , one surely 'll miss something vital.This reason fitting mass audience , hope wo n't happen , Nolan one favourite directors/writers , showed , brainless action flick n't it.There still movie like Inception still people like Nolans make movie , 's lost.And hope movie could show audience story still important experience one could receive , endless , constant explosions.Because really one lifetime event.Saying , must say , world full remake , reboots , sequel , prequels God know , unique chance see something different unmatched far-a strong movie , , surely Nolan 's latest masterpiece ! Grade wo n't change-it 's Nolan movies-sheer 10 !
 Dom Cobb lead highly skilled team , specializing stealing secret people 's mind entering dream . hired mysterious businessman , Cobb finally shot redemption , achieving near impossible . Rather stealing idea , must complete opposite : Inception . Planting seed idea.Inception multi-layered plot , quite literally fact . focus emotional journey lead character , Cobb , time thrust audience multiple level action packed story- telling , distinct one another , finely connected . described critic `` film reward intellect '' , assure exactly . Director Christopher Nolan challenge audience keep , reward breathtaking spectacle , one capability leave awestruck . best part may feel need watch able fully absorb experience , chance , probably want to.Christopher Nolan brings unique vision screen help star-studded cast , including like Leonardo Dicaprio ( Departed ) , Joseph Gordon-Levitt ( 500 Days Summer ) , Ellen Page ( Juno ) , Marion Cotillard ( Public Enemies ) , Cillian Murphy ( Batman Begins ) , Michael Caine ( Dark Knight ) , well amazing photography long time collaborator Wally Pfister . thrilling music film provided none Hans Zimmer , also set mood Nolan 's previous film , Dark Knight.While may seem simple outset , Inception extremely complex film , delving deep subconscious human mind . Technical brilliance visual splendor rarely blended together beautifully . emotional depth explosive action complement perfectly , delivering film time heart- wrenching heart-pounding . 's film manages engross complexity , yet come together seamlessly , edge seat , quite literally start finish.Inception magnificent .
 going IMDb user review lately ? 's like mass longer trusted . last month , user decreed `` Airbender '' worst abomination ever , fact 's average movie . User review raved `` Despicable '' , entertaining `` Dexter 's Lab '' rerun . ? `` Inception '' 3rd best movie ever made ? kidding ? creative interesting flick went waaaayyy overboard . problem genre ( know genre -- dream ? dream dream ? parallel universe people dream 're dreaming parallel universe pretending dream ) sooner later stop caring actual action 's dream . 20 minute spent watching gunfight car crash pouring rain , 30 minute spent watching guy shoot ski fortress , another 30 minute watching what's-his-name float around hotel n't . terrible movie , 3rd greatest movie ever ? must dreaming .
 'm nearly loss word . thought Christopher Nolan could n't follow `` Dark Knight '' , , delivering another masterpiece , one much power rich theme lost box office several year . Questioning illusion v reality usually make film weird , Nolan grip attention like iron claw ca n't help watching wondering happen next . real powerful skill director . wonder Warner Bros. put trust , good director , over-hyping Christopher Nolan film , matter film , always understatement instead overestimate like MANY film before.Not since era Stanley Kubrick , Andrei Tarkovsky Alfred Hitchcock brilliant director Christopher Nolan . , undoubtedly , one brilliant gifted Hollywood filmmaker history . Filmmakers like come lifetime . ability seduce eye , ear importantly , mind , delivers intends deliver full blast . Rarely blockbuster gall deliver amount imagination intelligence time . yes , similar excellent anime film `` Paprika '' whole `` invading dream '' plot , similarity end Nolan brings film whole different level.Visuals intelligence rarely come together movie time , 's either all-visuals-no-smarts ( `` G.I . Joe '' , `` Transformers '' ) exact opposite ( `` Doubt '' , `` Invictus '' ) . film excellently directed action sequence combined immensely groundbreaking jaw-dropping visual effect combined smoothly heavy dose intelligence believability.Although ensemble cast financed Hollywood giant studio ( Warner Bros ) , film personal film Nolan , wrote film well directing , watch film get many glimpse Nolan 's perplexing , increasingly imaginative thought dream dialog writes plot set . Ideas never felt interesting put good use film . film popcorn muncher , rather film thinker . Honestly ca n't explain plot fear spoiling movie reader . Even slightest hint ruin experience . viewer walk cinema feeling dazed , confused ultimately breathless . 's like puzzle , physically mentally , pay attention throughout film clue . However Nolan control spectacle film careful let overwhelm film 's humanity , `` Inception '' shine . deep film one thinking asking question year come . 's right , years.Once film end , 'll want watch , 's something new every time . film requires multiple viewing someone truly comprehend film 's ambiguous theme , discussed many future . original film , adaptation , sequel/prequel , remake/reboot , extremely refreshing gone nearly three year mostly unremarkable visual effect roadshows ( `` Avatar '' damned ) .Of course , film complete without actor . Leo DiCaprio delivers Oscar worthy performance , similar better previous effort `` Shutter Island '' . show glimpse flawed , grim , fragile man , knowledge everything else yet ca n't seem come grip demon . Joseph Gordon-Levitt , Ellen Page , Tom Hardy , Ken Watanabe , Dileep Rao , Cillian Murphy , Tom Berenger , Michael Caine , Marion Cottilard , Pete Postlethwaite , Lukas Haas ... Nolan really brings best unusual yet extremely talented group supporting actor make role own.Nolan course , master behind camera , real virtuoso come film . direction taut , focused , gripping , extraordinarily fascinating . detailed complex original script surprise Nolan , considering fact turned Batman superhero pop-culture art two year ago ( `` Dark Knight '' ) . action sequence unique , exciting fresh , something absent cinema since interested thing popping towards screen stuff blowing every two millisecond . visual effect awesome imaginative , best bring movie 's quality one bit , rather make movie fascinating watch . cinematography absolutely , beautifully shot , see action emotion glory . Production design top notch , terrific design set location . Hans Zimmer 's complementing music score simply outstanding , knowing man , 's really say . Together element combine deliver mesmerizing movie experience like year.Christopher Nolan outdone . truly gifted filmmaker , arguably imaginative Hollywood today . `` Inception '' proudly stand alongside `` Blade Runner '' `` 2001 : Space Odyssey '' science-fiction masterpiece push boundary movie making become different experience altogether.There two type film : crowd-pleasing blockbuster intelligent indie/art film . Nolan combined two trope together one exceptionally brilliant package , pulling rare , nearly-extinct Movie Magic since wiped planet sequelitis reboots . Movie Summer 2010 ? Movie 2010 ? Heck possibly first masterpiece decade ! Nolan genius applaud treating audience intelligent people.Missing film getting film 's point crime.Overall value : 9/10 ( Excellent )
 Inception truly one kind . concept long gestated Christopher Nolan 's mind , eye drama mixed large scale sensibility ring true Blockbuster season making Inception true original sea reboots , remake sequels.To try explain Inceptions many plot twist incredibly intelligent arc , would foolish task . Nolan reluctant . best way approach film would open mind , prepared taken ride lifetime , trust 100 % . Avatar seminal film technology ( although coming rather poor film , opinion ) , Inception seminal 's storytelling . 148 minute running time , would expect lot take place , would n't expect pace . think one time film long left . simply blown away depth every single part film . enthusiasm storytelling aspect film left worried spectacle , n't worry . , hinted trailer , incredible , looking real unbelievable simultaneously . pleasing thing action set piece , genuinely used illustrate story , rather blow stuff la Michael Bay.With complex movie 's high concept , stellar cast needed . Nolan always , delivers . vintage DiCaprio , perhaps equalled Aviator , even impressive role Cobb Inception showy one , needing DiCaprio constant centre film . pull Cobb 's emotional contradiction sublimely . rest cast member shine part film , Cillian Murphy show usually non-existent tender side , Gordon-Levitt bottle usual charm confidently reserved turn reliable Arthur , Watanabe devilish seemingly ambiguous Saito , Page show 's next big female star Tom Hardy revel comic relief film compared recent turn decidedly psychopathic characters.Overall , Nolan indeed surpassed . created world expansive Gotham , plot dwarfing intricacy Memento one blow Prestige 's cinematic reveal water . truly unmissable cinema . Revel , 've still got wait whole two year Batman 3 .
 ask summer blockbuster ? incites hysteria time every year whatever dross studio churn ? Epic hugeness ? Blowing stuff ? Romance ? Action ? Heroes ? looking blockbuster ? think boil thrill ! Audiences want thrill car chase , thrill romance , thrill spectacular ! case , Inception might greatest summer blockbuster time also contains something often n't look ... brain ! `` resilient parasite ? idea '' say Leonardo Di Caprio 's character Cobb . Well , Inception idea . 's right title . film central idea revolves around `` Extractors '' , paid extract secret people 's subconscious mind sneaking dream , usually purpose corporate espionage . However , one client asks plant idea mind corporate rival , `` Inception '' born . le said film better . full idea invention set piece divulge , piece film 's genius weakened . film cleverly intricately brings audience several plane existence simultaneously never allows viewer feel lost . power Christopher Nolan 's script , imagine , likely get overlooked due sheer visual magnificence direction . everything make film great script ... idea ! Everything else spectacle . film bear uncanny resemblance , thematically , DiCaprio 's instant classic year , Shutter Island . film investigate depth trick traumatised mind play individual . film luscious watch film keep audience firmly outside realm reality . However , Inception even layered film Shutter Island believe sci-fi genre setting prove le alienating audience prison noir Scorsese 's film . single dull moment Nolan 's film . style , charm intelligence every frame film . Every performance pitch-perfect strong support Ellen Page Joseph Gordon-Levitt particularly grown right eye undeniable movie star . Leonardo DiCaprio give typically flawless performance muddled , grieving man never quite trust living real world . best part Inception large amount effect done camera . film make use CGI , pretty mind-blowing practical effect simple camera telling beautiful lie ; rare treat day . blockbuster tick box ; smart , sexy ( femme fatale , sexy brainy girl , beautiful men beautiful suit ) magical . Inception kind film reminds cinema never die . anyone think 's OK watch film laptop iPad fool ! pure cinema , proud . missed big screen !
 privilege seeing movie came , , like DiCaprio 's film , blew away.Inception well-made movie , filmed 6 location world . directing outstanding , two moment , maybe three second total , noticed visual effect used ( course defying gravity pretty difficult ) . plot pleasingly intricate , twist-and-turn , keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat type feel . noticed film similarity DiCaprios thriller Shutter Island ( also enjoyed much ) seeing left wondering real . 's great see movie thick emotional plot grenade-throwing action hero achieve greatness end.Inception also well-composed score , finishing touch perfect movie . 're thinking seeing Inception , definitely go ! Even though fortunate enough see free show , worth every penny pay . Truly unique , like nothing 've ever seen . Christopher Nolan certainly covered new ground film n't afraid leave u hanging spectacular ending .
 ignore fact . ignore mistake plot hole , bad writing , bad marketing . ignore hype , especially 's already IMDb top 250 , received praise critic , cashed lot money , people call stunning unforgettable . simple truth Inception live hype . Let start trailer . coolest thing ( folding city , collapsing cliff , train street ) totally unessential plot . None take second . put poster well ? Nevermind . 'll move real problem movie.So heard people saying complex movie . 'll need watch twice . shocking ending blow mind . knew exactly `` shocking ending '' would half way film . last paragraph review deal ending . 's exactly spoiler skip n't want know anything.Cobb ( DiCaprio ) take mission implant thought Fischer 's ( Murphy ) mind . reward , contractor Saito ( Watanabe ) clean record LAPD . Cobb wanted murder wife consequently ca n't return USA see child . Throughout movie , Cobb 's main inner conflict , fled country , n't get chance see kid ' face want see . Michael Cain small role grandpa DiCaprio 's father-in-law . n't Cain take kid someplace could father ? People move time . n't send Cobb home movie want see face much ? could even video call stuff . 's long distance relationship 's something . Well , apparently one thought , main character 's main motivation action make sense . acting , DiCaprio good . 've seen Shutter Island , 've seen third Inception . Dead wife , small kid , sense loss , pretty wooden house field , flashback Teddy Shutter Island 's Inception . Minus funny Boston accent.The mission mind thief embark plant idea rich guy 's mind . called inception . Hence title , guess . Everyone say 's impossible , know going succeed end . Inception essentially heist movie , instead getting vault , Cobb 's team get inside someone 's mind  happens look like vault . supposed complexity movie boil idea dream within dream . Basically , imagine plugged inside matrix , plug yet another , deeper , matrix . , explained super complex plot movie . case n't enough , Ellen page 's character , Ariadne . obligatory new member team introduced represent audience question . 'm fine . Every movie one uninitiated people . thing , understands everything quickly becomes suddenly becomes competent character . Pretty convenient , ask me.Let finally get mission .

Watanabe hire DiCaprio plant idea splitting company Murphy 's mind . . two half hour . n't care split big company . care Murphy bigger company Watanabe ? stake movie n't high , nonexistent . given reason care whether succeed . 'm given action set piece look forward , lot cool slow motion zero gravity fight reminiscent Matrix , 'm given reason care happening . liked Watanabe 's character like Ken Watanbe . Saito , n't give damn competitor destroys company . n't tell u consequence would , n't show u happens company , n't anything initial idea . strange , movie idea important . Okay , n't like plot acting nothing new . rest ? Hans Zimmer 's unremarkable score work well scene would super boring hear . visual effect good since coolest city-folding scene short , n't really much . zero gravity stuff done well , 'll give . Cinematography good , bordering much shaky camera.Here 's paragraph ending : big ending supposed unsure dream reality . real , 's stupid DiCaprio dozen way kid without making thing incredibly complicated . movie supposed make think , think whole plot fall apart . dream , 's stupid cop Nolan 's part . excuse thing n't make sense . dream , screw , audience .

 say make impressive trailer uninteresting film , take doing.Here element would make good film . great special effect , sci-fi conundrum , beautiful visuals good sound . Yet important part film missing . plot , character soul film . 's like beautiful building outside paint decoration inside.It 's empty shell film . tension ; could n't care le character , even motivated . Helping corporation get `` one '' another corporation hardly saving human race.When operate dream environment , ca n't die injured really mean nothing worry , care happens . explosion action sequence meaningless . way , Hollywood still keep filming action scene 's inch away every character nose ? 's impossible see 's going , many film ruined . Watch learn Matrix , take camera backwards couple foot actually work 's going on.So 2 half hour looking watch waiting predictable ending , million mile good film . anyone right mind give 10/10 , 's boring pointless . film stir soul , grab , need feel character . anyone , honestly say , cared anyone show here.By way , 's idea , n't bring child ( n't aged minute since last saw ) , ca n't go US.I know end scene trying ambiguous , fact father , life Paris , bizarrely US meet ( know ) child look identical every dream sequence appeared , mean n't much doubt.In end nothing stake anyone , pointless movie . suspect Nolan continue get praise , ca n't really say 've got excited movie . leave cold . terrible , 's nothing really , substance .
 Unless call movie masterpiece . are.Damn 1,000 word limit . Got ta make quick.Spoilers.The film 2.5 hour long , yet feel like 5.2 , reason . One fact preponderance first act amateurish , conflict-free exposition , bode well repeat viewings.The `` learning dream world '' scene atrocious . conflict . Leo Page 's character already knew explained . similar `` learning matrix '' scene Matrix right one character know anything . Plus , conflict . Neo get as kicked fails make building jump . Much entertaining.There 's another problem whole section bending landscape Leo explains negative aspect altering dream world . closest get seeing dream world altered Leo becoming Mr. Charlie , yet happens bunch extra turn look Leo . 's . idea exploited . literally go way miss opportunity . Hell , Mr. Charles scene shorter scene explains altering dream world bad ! Let 's forget whole idea one corporation one-upping another absolutely personal ramification anyone screen audience . would greatly amped internal conflict Leo struggle notion helping guy could help would endanger someone else close , u , someone else . ANYTHING could worked better energy contract mean le neighbor 's bath mat . Come . totem handled poorly . need know purpose . n't need know anything else , yet film keep piling needle information.If heist film , threat caught ? van fall endless amount time . Joseph Gordon-Levitt float body hallway half hour , real-time . guy Bronson thing , whatever hell . complex task event , rather straight-forward nature . Dragging solid chunk film creates glacial pace make long film seem even longer.Inception real villain . make case Cotillard , internal enemy . never take `` physical '' presence never threatens anyone except Leo . Everyone else dealing faceless assassin . make feel distant rest action . n't even anything , emotionally , Leo 's goal getting home see kid . None tied together . Leo n't even know hell going Cillian never even knew outcome fact . 's separated physical manifestation goal majority film . ended caring plan succeeded . somehow tied together , audience would able experience great emotional catharsis everyone talking ... n't happen.In fact , Leo separated actual plot literally put Levitt place even need hero dream world ! Hell , even put Page , since designing boring lifeless dream world hang guy tell Leo 's crazy . really wish something else besides play part fifth wheel.Leo 's lack involvement main action story creates 'so ? ' moment problem solved , think absolutely reason hero one conquer main conflict . Brody kill shark Jaws . n't send Hooper Quint dirty work stay behind deal fear water . 's integrated . hero forced dealing physical , turn , learn conquer internal fear conquer external opponent . Screen writing 101 , Lesson 1 , Nolan got wrong . 's n't believe report spent 10 year writing script since took 148 minute figure exactly wrong it.Not mention conceit enter someone else 's dream control mean would control subconscious , state elsewhere impossible . Way go , genius.Pretty much everything film wrong , Matrix right . Watch instead.PS : 'taking scene middle putting beginning ' gag reached peak effectiveness 2002 absolutely place modern film . 's getting bad tired old 'It 's dream ' scenario . Oh , wait ...

Well , , movie insult average intelligent viewer , directed Christopher Nolan , ultimate disappointment .
 central idea `` Inception '' interesting one : technology exists enter people 's dream order steal private secret implant new idea . Christopher Nolan `` Memento '' fame writer director , smart , compelling movie . Unfortunately , `` Inception '' bloated failure.The root problem Nolan replaces fascinating surrealism dream world lengthy outtake James Bond movie . example , early film , Cobb Ariadne sitting café dream world , Cobb tell Ariadne stay calm . 's going happen ? waiter going bring glass full wriggling eyeball ? going turn around see best friend high school sex Abraham Lincoln ? . THINGS START EXPLODING . 's whole movie nutshell : gaudy special effect endless fight scene poor substitute imaginative ideas.The matryoshka-doll plot dream within dream n't nearly hard follow one might imagine . largely nothing consequence happens higher level hero moved deeper level . higher-level supporting actor fight bad guy -- overblown special effect -- 's time bring back colleague depths.Nolan sit back , watch best movie Luis Bunuel David Lynch , try one-tenth budget ten time imagination . ( Okay , 's never gon na happen , 's *my* dream . )

 Christopher Nolan done great work.His idea direction singlehandedly gave new life beloved superhero Batman.While film Dark Knight always recognized new dimension added classic Batman series movie comic , Inception nothing dull linear plot , surrounded even duller linear plot.The centerpiece movie supposed convoluted storyline scattered across multiple level , essence puzzle force viewer think movie decipher ending.The concept `` level '' `` interconnected plot '' worked well great film Matrix , 2001 Space Odyssey , Logan 's Run , Total Recall . Inception miserably fails also lack place well.-Characters : Great actor , done great work many movie spanning decade . However character movie came neutered eunuch lacked sense , emotion , sort cohesiveness . ( Sir Michael Caine Tom Berenger 's performance appalling `` team '' dreamer lacked screen dynamic chemistry . ) -Action : dream world , action movie unimaginative well within typical Hollywood bound . Car cash scene hero drive shoot , building shootout , melodramatic bullet wound ( always one character wounded critically , team must save ; however character still `` fight '' . ) -Plot : movie could easily within 1 hour rolling . Inception 's `` puzzle ending '' blatantly obvious 40 min film , storyline self lacked substance draw . overly complicated `` puzzle piece '' effect Nolan trying achieve , nothing main story line surrounded excessive fluff whimsical bullplop . *I credit movie one notable mention . Nolan managed work Matrix style fight scene ( overdone Hollywood since early 2000s ) small confines elevator.In ending , Inception great rave many make . movie take place `` dream world '' , bound limitless , movie sterile , cliché , repetitive , unimaginative . even compounded one dimensional character , drawn storyline pretend enigma.Perhaps Christopher Nolan 's true intent make sterile lack luster movie aimed strictly making today 's self-absorbed obtuse Facebook-hipster generation feel `` smart '' .Inception compared class presentation student unprepared . hide , student us convoluted circular logic stammer presentation pas time . obvious student know nothing wasted several minute talking subject could explained second . Nonetheless , since student used `` big word '' , talked excessively , deemed `` mainstream '' class give standing ovation regardless ...

 Inception n't bring anything fresh original like everybody 's claiming calling intellectual movie insult . tried , n't succeed due poor , nonsensical writing.The soundtrack n't match movie , 's suspenseful movie suspense whatsoever.The mission something ca n't really connect n't know really.There really sense danger point dream ( ) limbo idea n't make sense . using limbo concept character could n't care le lived died , come , would care multi-millionaire asshole 's trying get even richer destroying competition ? could n't go back US `` think killed '' ? law work , evidence killed , witness , nothing , would never convicted , Leonardo , go back go court please ; - ) could used imaginative dream world instead Dark knight Gotham city day time , James Bond ice Fortress style Matrix like corridor ( hallway ) .The faceless subconscious militia , booooring . maybe problem subconscious people imagination . come crazy dream like scene movie dreaming ? dream much interesting scene movie ... could go want lower high rating , 9 10 3 4 movie deserves .

Seeing piece garbage rated 9 10 made wan na vomit . enough , let 's get serious issue movie . 1 : Leonardo DiCaprio changed role last 5 year . one notice ? always play guy deep seated emotional issue relating loss loved one . play anything else besides loner lost love life psychological scar go deep hit street 's standing ? 2 : n't shoot stupid wife anytime showed ? n't guy team knew mess thing . say , `` Hey guy , see wife shoot 's going get u killed .

 movie predictable take 10 minute figure . stage know 're going waste another 2 half hour watching nonsense people slip dream attempt fabricate story story.The plot start first minute end last minute , everything ... well ... better left unwatched.If n't figured immediately , chance wo n't time 's , case 're also wasting 2 half hour time.The thing got watching horrible overrated bloated cinematic experiment wish kill . Maybe 'm dreaming , ?
 UNDERWHELMING , LITERAL PRETENTIOUS.. 3 word pretty much summed whole Inception . populate dream world landscape tone real world ? dreamer subconscious armed real-world accessory firearm ? must travel initiated actor 's pretend sleep ? level differentiated different decor ? ( Except LIMBO realm ) IMAGINATION ? Nolan perfect opportunity execute wildest imagination messed served u mediocrity . Apparently , literal interpretation dream . quirky visual manifestation ( mirror-world ? top-down switched ? ) , mystical representation subconscious ( shadow , shade , animal etc ) , difference dream level ( tones-darker ? grayer ? grotesque ? ) , symbolic representative weapon ( energy ? aura 's ? light ? dark ? ) . COURSE , travel method ! NOLAN could 've presented sophisticated facade . Maybe dream room vivid machine powered mysterious matter . mobility , visible contraption head , neck body . , transition cued portal , one 's self entering target 's body ... .to fantastical ; reality bleeds tear underworld dream.INSTEAD , 've got inferior chase action set piece .

 Alright , 's thing ; yes , cool complexity . Yes , cool many layer thought screen going . Yes , cool Chris Nolan managed make something unique fairly independent one movie complex enough account whole trilogy movie almost genre . 's thing ; rather alarming logical leap could get over.1.The Projections ; Okay , thing inhabit street person 's subconscious manifestation various component brain evidenced fact character need find something dreamer 's perception someone else follow manifestation dream . Makes sense , thought dreamer think would , real person would . saw went 'wow , make sense ! Clever ! ' , towards end movie say 'nevermind , 're projection ; n't actually mean anything , part mind n't killed . ' little convenient liking.2.The Totems ; n't top fall dream world ? keep spinning perpetually ? Everything else obeys law basic physic , would n't ? probably dumbest thing 've seen movie year ; n't even attempt made explain . honestly say bad 'only prime kill prime ' Trasformers 2.3 . Architect/Dreamer Relationship ; architect choose world enter ? person 'projects ' character world person 's 'the dreamer ' ? dreaming , every single one , altering world 're character . ca n't projection anything cooler normal guy gun ? detected intruder mind 'd summon nuke Godzilla Optimus Prime get , boring henchman probably would n't able get job done anyways.4 .

ANYONE made movie without figuring deserve jettisoned sun stupidity . caught moment mentioned inception possible.5 . Waking Up/Dying Dream die dream world come back level towards consciousness , evidenced fact wake get shot face first scene . wait ! die dream actually go limbo evidenced happening oriental guy , suck 's 's 'pure subconscious ' wake vegetable . wait ! actually n't endless limbo Cobb Molly went , still wake vegetable . wait ! actually n't wake vegetable Cobb Molly n't killed train track . limbo still bad ... ... .right ? ca n't get without becoming mentally handicapped , kill get time like normal dream limbo even bad ? n't inertia supposed wake ? Technically van falling bridge woken , even rolling , hitting water . force hitting water woke , n't anything like slap face ? end movie suffered EXACT thing Dark Knight , Chris Nolan 's conflicting desire make something believable sensationalism , cancelling . wanted compare obvious similar franchise , Matrix actually believable . Oh , yeah , think matrix , tiny needle plugged wrist plug alternate reality Inception ? base skull made sense , silly . People keep saying next Matrix , difference literally twenty view later everything Matrix STILL make sense , punched hole latest Leonardo Decrapio movie one sitting . Pathetic .

 Wow ? hast thou put eye ? Could Christopher Nolan 's boorish tripe 'Inception ' ? could tell movie far low brow make even slightest impression vastly superior intelligence . Nolan amateur make movie based blatantly foreseeable childish artifice unintelligent boor would find least bit amusing . 'Inception ' kind film designed make lamebrains feel like intelligent . Nolan 's intellectualism-for-dummies main title biography . Luckily smart enough see past charade give people fair assessment tripe . 'Inception ' built upon notion traveling dream like space bend time , space , reality , yawn . 's done Chris much sounder fashion Charlie Kaufman 's epic masterpiece 'Synecdoche , New York ' . film orgasmic experience 'Inception ' beyond word describing . mean might conclude inner subconscious would creative coming better metaphor security guy gun chase . lengthy exposition- oh mean training montage , despite semi-acceptable computer effect , way boring le engaging scene stole 'The Matrix ' , least scene n't Nolan 's pretentiousness .

 n't get wrong , Christopher Nolan ( writer , producer director movie ) , talented filmmaker . undoubtedly make masterpiece remembered . 's point : n't made yet . Dark Knight n't Inception certainly n't . Inception product director given carte blanche . vision put film without someone ever saying : 'Chris , 's going work .

 Philosophically absurd . main point gathered :  Faith doubt discussed , conclusion faith n't matter ca n't know 's real anyways . Japanese businessman 's non-faith avail di Caprio 's character 's faith avail ? ended destiny , ? , freewill illusion , too. Skepticism valid approach life. Existentialism true ; really make life whatever want .

Every subject make reality . lead solipsism ultimately suicidal nihilism. Murder justified long person killing someone 's `` projection . '' Di Caprio 's character snipe men snow scene architect girl 's surprise ; justifies saying another man 's `` projection . ``  Magic potion ( i.e. , potent drug ) solution anyone 's problems.Christopher Nolan brush-up real , Aristotelean-Thomistic philosophy , maybe movie would fooled audience thinking profound instead absurd . good partsthe importance fatherhood family , examplebut overshadowed ambiguity sake ambiguity.Also , artistically , could 've done without car-chase shooting scene confronted head-on philosophical issue raising , i.e. , `` real ? , existence ?

 Inception explores dream human mind Star Wars explores outer space . Inception rip-off novel Fireflies Shadow Sun ( FSS ) , published 2004 preceded web site dream ( 2001-2009 ) , thrust dream experience source idea change waking life , including personality development . broader point like character Dom Cobb , Nolan steal idea need create Inception novelist life long dream researcher.Chapter 7 titled `` Journey Deflection '' occurs entirely shared dream 2 protagonist ascend / descend `` level dreaming '' action-oriented sequence even `` dream within dream , '' addressing intermittent awareness dream affect dream . Inception ( ) intrigue / illuminate level distinct yet intrinsically related ( b ) draw real dream real similarity waking life . Inception action film set dream space neglect essence dreaming dream symbolism . dream space featured Inception fictitious -- contrivance Nolan architect Nolan 's story . Inception would benefited emulating FSS one way emulate . FSS character trapped shared dream solve dream 's logic order wake . plot much conducive education language dream , FSS author spent entire lifetime understanding time started diary dream age 13 doctoral dissertation age 27 exploring relationship dream experience , coping strategy , blood chemistry , symptom terminally ill cancer patient . Like FSS however , yet another coincidental similarity two work , Inception character thwarted dream plugged mental effort understand . Also FSS , dreamer deal denizen dream world react periodic episode lucid awareness dream . FSS , whole script , including object aspect environment , respond awareness , Inception get juvenile scientifically ignorant development character dream respond Dom Cobb team like white blood cell foreign pathogen . bottom line FSS teach u thing dream Inception impress psychologically unsophisticated among u never remembered dream life.Also like FSS , Inception make point much bizarreness dream attributable higher-order thinking . using statement similar one former FSS web site , maintained dreaming whole brain activity , conscious person us 3-5 % brain . FSS author remark experiencing trying make sense dream like trying fit 100 % something 3-5 % -- distortion ! subject matter notwithstanding , Nolan 's storytelling direction designed give artificial weight real value plot twist . Nolan director conceals compensates second-rate thinking CGI high-octane action detracts story without getting blood flowing . action film supposed create sense time-sensitive suspense , came across like dull dishwater backing sink raging river.There also inconsistency film . Nolan want u invest idea everything happens dream effect waking life dreamer . work -- Dom Cobb dismisses hand shooting dream character like throng disposable orcs storm trooper , claiming OK `` merely projection subconscious . '' Suddenly , happens dream Vegas stay dream Vegas . idea `` limbo '' come -- introduced patchwork device poorly articulated plot.And much film 's premise contradicted real research show relationship perceived actual dream time roughly 1:1 .

See Aware Dreaming Dream Within Dream : great part . movie secondary plot line . Forget whole dream idea whether dream 's dream kid precisely position , age outfit last scene DiCaprio 's previous recollection . Apparently character Leonardo DiCaprio based Nolan ; director . film making movie . DiCaprio director , Joseph Gordon-Levitt producer , Ellen Page screenwriter , Tom Hardy actor , Dileep Rao technical guy , Ken Watanabe money man behind movie Cillian Murphy audience.Do Hear Music ? : whole movie explaining audience staff must create semi believable world victim , mark , audience drawn . scouting location , creating world getting audience lost , giving director enough time plant non-original idea , , `` great movie ! '' Anyone feel sorry Cillian Murphy / Robert Fisher , Jr. getting screwed ? well thats Murphy getting screwed , u ! Inner Ear Intact Imax Noise , Comes Kick : According DiCaprio 's character Nolan , alter dream world much , like Ellen Page DiCaprio 's dream , victim's/audience 's subconscious turn , realizing fake/ dream , turn manipulator dream , thus screenwriter , director , etc . become disengaged film/dream wake-up , `` good afternoon , glad see awake . `` Remember ? : remember original `` Architect '' get killed beginning ? Well apparently common movie industry replace/remove first screen writer . watch interview DeCaprio say studying Noal character film , know why.Now , wipe morning-glory eye go outside play .
 verge leaving Cinema completely ridiculously story . hung ( also despite insanely annoying music ) though , simply shocked film ( currently ) top 3 position movie ever made . Perhaps entered ( bad ) dream yet woken ... backdrop story basically bunch guy drug people enter dream world using plastic box wire attached entering dream . dream use technique ( box drug apart dream.. ) enter another dream . process repeated number time - movie go fourth dream-layer . killed dreaming wake - unless heavily sedated ( real-life , also one dream ? .. ) , put `` limbo '' state - potentially last year . want get dream safely - need `` kicked '' ( sharp acceleration ) dream-layer one currently . unsure dreaming , `` totem '' ( physical object unspecified reason behaves differently dream - ? ) examine.I hate . Simply hate ... good thing see movie ending : DiCaprio see kid - look exactly done dream - aged . mean still dreaming therefore stuck new limbo dream world - LONG time . Phew ... mean wo n't sequel wake . Unless 's still dreaming .
 obvious people enjoy psychological thriller , virtual reality , Leonardo DiCaprio . Inception , , astonish marvel crowd cinema goer thinking smart profound getting liking movie . say , admire movie 's performance tricking viewer like ; 's , trick . dream within dream , n't sound attractive ... kind movie get nominated Oscar crowd pleasing ability , Oscars born within capitalist world need capital get . like Avatar got nominated `` best movie '' category ... 've read review saying Inception could movie decade ; obviously , guy n't see many movie last ten year ; better movie 2010 , bunch them.I 'm saying movie bad ; 's good movie genre ; n't like fuss created ( fuss disappear like disappeared crowd adored film ) , mostly lack authenticity , therefore PRETENTIOUSNESS.This gem - pile dust eye .
 tried another matrix - ) already one matrix b ) silly matrix , much sillier c ) matrix personality , move feel whatsoeverBest example lameness would `` introduction scene '' Dicaprio 's character ( totally forgettable ) show young architect dream world . scene totally forgettable compared epic action scene Morpheous Neo ( `` Stop trying hit hit '' ) Also - hardly build - go 2 layer dream 6 , whats build ? layer dream ? Ridiculous .
 Cobb extractor , enters mind powerful people take idea . latest case simple , instead taking idea , must implant one ; however Cobb man whose sub-conscience disarray dead wife threatens destroy him.I thought originally watched trailer ...

However , complexity film quite confusing time , even life long sci-fi fan ; guess allure consider many , many positive glowing review . enjoyed action sequence , really keep edge seat . Cillian Murphy Ken Wattanbe , true star opinion , played role well , Leonardo DiCaprio one dimensional , even though supposed complex intriguing character film .

 Ten year story , Christopher Nolan . hardly understand difficult understand would intellectual piece rubbish dream within dream within dream . Night Shyamalan done movie . Boring u death boring story 9/10th movie give u 'amazing ending ' , ending fact three layered dream dream within dream within dream within dream 4 layer , least 's impression spinning thing end talisman either wife Leonard di Caprio.From trailer seemed brilliant movie warned colleague work , one leaving theater ending others understanding fuss right are.Before year never believed Leonardo di Caprio able play adult character ( ) watching Titanic year ago . 'm dead sure watching Shutter island Inception year.Characters without character n't give damn ; endless ridiculously action scene certainly towards end working action climax incredibly foreseeable ( dream layer ending time ) ; heavy pseudo sophisticated acting get nerve quickly . one sentence : biggest scam since matrix though Wachowski brother even bigger crook scammed world three time . idiot u public , ? problem 'amazing ending ' movie least would make effort give story leading . none.I agree really serious bad thing get offended world , feel offended real life conned situation product , scammed movie theater.The 1 point give movie 'street bending ' special effect ( effect rather tedious pure special effect effect ) .
 one point Cobb tell u despite best effort , create dream wife depth complexity real wife . Could Nolan 's subconscious , commenting limitation writer director ? Cobb undertakes plant idea someone 's head Cobb 's employer monopolize industry .

 Seriously ? Mesmerizing ? Fantastic ? Genius ? No.I pretty excited film hype , feel massively let . plot overly drawn repetitive , over-reliance action , massive portion plot taken filler scene silly shoot-outs car chases.Christopher Nolan given film superficial sheen meaningfulness , admittedly astounding visuals covering plot full hole 's almost falling apart .

 reading amazing review seeing score 9.3 ... 3rd best movie time , go watch Inception . Also really like Memento ... cool , original movie..so looking forward this.I went see movie last weekend . 11:00pm showing Sunday night , 3 week opening night theatre packed ! sit second row ... something n't mind all.Epic Fail movie corporate ( even government ) spy , enter people 's dream unexplained technology . dream , trick victim giving his/her secret . Pretty simple premise , one taken many direction ( 're dreamland ) . Well direction crapper.The whole premise movie shallow , Saito , corporate CEO hire Cobb ( Leo ) go another CEO 's dream plant idea breaking father empire ( upon father 's death ) , Saito monopoly . 's story ? ? joke.Well movie start slow drag , besides many plot hole explaining everything happens..like manipulate victim dream , within dream , within dream . falling first dream , second layer gravity , third forth layer gravity ? ? WHAAAA ? ? ? Also even though dream , super powers..you use boring gun ? shooting lighting bolt know ? ? BOOORRING.To add boredom , Cobb 's wife Mal killed thought dreaming . appears regularly bore u death , get sense 's supposed evil , never pan out.This interesting one level ... antagonist . love interest either , top danger , cause get killed dream , wake up.This movie amoral tripe imagination..eg . dream world , instead driving around VAN , fly ? Instead shooting gun , freeze track ? Also , many people ( assume teenager ) saying original movie . Dream within Dream thing done ... 's called `` Nightmare Elm Street Part 3 : Dream Warriors '' ..also n't EVER compare tripe `` Matrix '' . Matrix original , filled clever allegory , truly awe inspiring , NOTHING clever Inceptipon.The climax okay , 2 hour could n't wait get there.Now anti-climax , entirely different animal , like viewer n't insulted enough ... left ponder weather `` dream '' ( original ) . answer yes , dream , Cobb still dream..his kid look exactly , even wearing clothes dreams.Please favour pay see garbage . far best movie summer Predators ... sad . People think movie clever original teenagers..it probably clever original , adult find movie dull boring . Inception = Fail IMDb Inception top 3 movie = EPIC FAIL.If credibility Nazi , 'd say IMDb `` CREDIBILITY ! `` 2/10 exploiting big budget .
 'll begin saying inbuilt prejudice film seem put cleverness 'intelligence ' ahead entertainment value . read lot film , n't sure whether would like , fact disappointed end disliking much did.For , film lacked two essential element entertaining movie - coherent plot sympathetic character . plot n't really start make sense halfway ( far late ) Leonardo di Caprio central character , Cobb , competent n't charisma carry kind story . wife 's death foreshadowed lot early part film found n't care died . None character came across real people connection Cobb generally unclear . impression good actor ( like Tom Hardy ) basically wasted.I almost switched film first twenty minute chaotic action seemed designed almost alienate viewer . started make sense , still long way good film . over-reliance sudden loud noise ( way level dialogue ) first half simply irritating.The film also seemed trouble obeying internal logic . Several reviewer mentioned consistency supposed happen dreamer dy dream ; unimpressed 'projections ' dream apparently personality capable independent thought , although script also nothing figment dreamer 's imagination.Yes , film 's setting special effect impressive , 's really evening ( ) . story characterisation lacking , bother watching ?
 Inception interesting movie , however enjoy . go movie entertained , transported movie , involved emotion stirred . Inception none , failed focused creativity forgot audience . Credit must given special effect , acting creative content , praise stop there.I read lot review say 'm surprised , simply n't agree high rating movie awarded . would like watch interesting , creative action packed movie , disappoint . , many implausible ( bordering ridiculous ) twist enable enjoy . technical aspect surrounding connectivity participant nonsense , little explanation , little offered worked . Clearly someone thought audience would let part slide fussed technicalities.This selfish movie , written , produced directed creative , amazing intelligent.. problem someone forgot audience . one engaged , transported emotion stirred..apart feeling annoyed disappointed.I expected much movie..
 well , well , well , oh hang , need another well ... ... crap , crap , crap , yes another crap ... ... concept going dream stealing planting idea probably acceptable , even dream within dream palatable , hey guy - let 's go third level 're , let 's try fourth well - messy , badly scripted piece junk . movie place whilst follow concentration chess master , plot storyline weak rather pathetic . Wasted lot time watching one , favour go mow lawn something ! Save money wait DVD 're curious .
 Leonardo DiCaprio agreed play lead part 'Inception ' , spent month Christopher Nolan trying improve script . DiCaprio 's insistence part playing , Cobb , corporate dream extractor , beefed internal arc . Otherwise , Inception would turn another shallow , action adventure thriller . Despite Cobb 's triumph internal demon ( particularly way expunges dead wife , haunting subconscious ) , Inception much exploration mechanic dreaming chronicle emotional catharsis . basic level , Inception divided four distinct part : Intro , Exposition , Journey Resolution . Intro consists initial scene , flashback Cobb must save employer , sleazy Japanese businessman , Saito , far advanced year , stuck limbo-like purgatory decade , unaware mortally wounded someone else 's dream . 's nice , little compact scene see near-dead Cobb , washed beach dragged Saito 's fortress compound . gun left table front Saito 're trying figure whether Saito going kill Cobb . Cut next scene Cobb associate involved trying extract information much younger Saito inside one dream , sleep bullet train somewhere Japan . Apparently , Saito expecting dream extractor informs 'audition ' ; extractor ' 'architect ' , guy charge designing dreamworld , somehow let thing get control mob men invade room 're staying , Saito later thug toss architect roof heliport . Despite botched job , Saito impressed Cobb partner able move different 'levels ' dreamworld . Cobb 's 'audition ' could compressed one two minute Nolan insists illustrating every aspect convoluted plot . finally arrive film 's inciting incident : Saito 's proposal Cobb enter dream world business rival , Fischer , plant suggestion subconscious , leading dissolution rival 's entire business empire . 'Inception ' reverse Cobb team trained doextracting information Cobb doubt successfully carrying Saito 's proposal . Saito promise pull string , enabling Cobb return United States , despite murder charge hanging head , Cobb ca n't resist jumping chance see two child again.The next part 'Inception ' , 'exposition ' , take hour . Cobb assembles new carefully selected `` Mission Impossible '' superstar team penetrate Fischer 's mind plant suggestion break dying father 's business empire . Nolan 's explanation mechanic dreamworld complicated , Cobb explain new architect , naive graduate student manages acquit rather well despite facing major obstacle inside multiple dreamworld . Nolan manages violate major tenet screen writing technique : Show n't tell . Unfortunately , expository sequence , 's lot 'tell ' 'show ' . Yes , rather neat scene ( reminiscent M. C. Escher illustration ) , one Paris landscape fold top another visuals much mundane : example , speeding locomotive appears nowhere car chase Paris street.Much written 'journey ' aspect 'Inception ' . Critics seem impressed three dreamworld 'dream team ' penetrates , coupled way 're able return realitythe so-called 'kicks ' , huge sound explosion propels different level back surface . Nolan , however , serf dullest derivative landscape 'heroes ' must navigate throughin fact , so-called dream n't look like dream . Take Level 1just typical shoot em faceless bad guy chasing 'good guy ' . level 2I felt watching parody Space Odyssey , dreamer floating hotel without benefit gravity . Finally , heard 'Level 3 ' , compared 'Ice Station Zebra ' , schlocky 60 action film set Arctic.Inception 's Resolution unsatisfying earlier part film . make Cobb ? made deal Saito enables see child , mitigate fact whole plan literally change Fischer 's mind , reprehensible . , n't Cobb walked away Saito men murder first architect ? Cobb , large , remains tainted unsympathetic character , precisely look way 's quite aware Saito committed murder.We 're also told ( Saito ) breakup Fischer 's empire good thing take word ? 's thug Nolan provided u nothing go evaluate nature Fischer empire . Finally , Fischer cry father 's deathbed ? 's learned father put mother mental institution n't angry ? tear joy 'his man ' ? bulk 'Inception ' merely pastiche mediocre action adventure espionage thriller dating back 60 genre full bloom . long-winded 'B ' story , Cobb 's tortured machination trying literally kick dead wife subconscious mind , merely serf distract u hollowness overall plot .
 Inception written , produced , directed Christopher Nolan . film star Leonardo DiCaprio , Ken Watanabe , Joseph Gordon-Levitt , Marion Cotillard , Ellen Page , Tom Hardy , Cillian Murphy , Dileep Rao , Tom Berenger , Michael Caine . musical score Hans Zimmer Wally Pfister cinematographer . Plot find DiCaprio playing Dom Cobb , specialised spy hire steal idea dream people . one day get different offer , one enable see estranged child . get reward must enact Inception , planting idea mind selected target . Inception thought impossible Cobb selected team fail ? consequence unthinkable.There already much written pondered regard Inception relatively short running time life . One imagine written said ten year time . although 's arguably bit early talking held high regard like 2001 : Space Odyssey , 's inescapable Nolan 's movie current generation 's sci-fi classic . Nolan managed make accessible mainstream , dazzled eye much brain process , close piece genius craftsmanship.Inception film 's better know nothing venturing , asks , well Nolan asks , undivided attention . 's neither confusing painted , tricks-peek behind curtain type-up sleeve . truth Inception something everyone ; thematically speaking , 's pore special effect see Nolan raising bar considerably . case twisty high concept movie , interpretation many , director rightly abstaining discourse movie . form basis basic life death struggle , grey area given clever cinematic make . 's also meditation grief reviewer personally found easy get involved ; course wont work everyone , one many strand Nolan dangles discerning viewer.If sound bit serious man redefined Super Hero genre , rest assured thrill seeker , Inception also loud swirly spectacle . action raucous , gun fight zero gravity punch ups , Nolan lost ability take viewer action fuelled roller-coaster ride , aided superbly Lee Smith 's editing Pfister 's perfectly broad photography Zimmer 's score blend electronic action pulse beat saddened guitar strain ( ex-Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr 12 string ) craft one best score 2010 . said , 's something everyone , making perhaps one leading nominee title ultimate modern day blockbuster.Then 's strong ensemble cast , led quite scintillating performance DiCaprio . Following card played close chest turn Shutter Island , DiCaprio given 2010 two best lead performance . give real depth emotion , kind make easy viewer hang hat . unfussy acting easy buy , giving character air believability , glue bind whole film together . Murphy wonderfully vulnerable , much axis narrative , Levitt almost usurps DiCaprio neatly layered portrayal carry delightful whiff duality . Special praise , , Ellen Page . Still early 20 , exudes intelligent sexiness shine bright role could boorishly played cipher lesser actress ' hand . Hardy provides brawny levity Berenger leaf favourable mark.The Matrix meet Heat Mission Impossible , 's written Phillip K.

 waited patiently see updated home theater Blu-ray anticipation excitement , mainly based high score given IMDb knowledge everything ; cast , sound , scenery , story , etc . OK , looked impressive , loud enough , 2 ½ hour jaw floor utter amazement stupid people praising trash - lemming . maybe 's explainable : ten star review either involved directly marketing film 9 year old boy using parent credential praise adolescent epic suppose idiot swallow tripe enjoy making recommendation others yummy tripe tasted . latter almost doubt intellectually challenged might difficulty forming sentence operating computer machine thousand reviewer praising theatrical garbage ? absolutely first guess ; Armies troll hired maker Crapception.I ca n't even get offer reason disliking film 's nothing review 'll try : repetitive overlapping scene seemed like demo video testing CGI production equipment . complete absence explanation someone actually share dream feel biggest hole , hole got deeper deeper deep deeper still resulting probably shallow script ever produced much money.I typically like DiCaprio Cisco girl ; Ellen Page annoying , felt like bad Juno dream TV commercial selling conferencing equipment horribly dressed adolescent trapped dream spun mind .

 movie disappointing dreadfully bad . People victim marketing campaign : `` movie complex , intellectual multi-layered n't understand stupid '' . People n't like stupid seen 's written , produced directed guy Dark Knight n't think anymore go see Inception.So , show Mr. Nolans movie opposition `` complex intelligent '' : SUPERFICIAL . least 6 arguments:1 . character silhouette , transparent shallow . psychological deepness ; protagonist emotionless object moved place place like chess figure . n't soul . marked movie developing character . Sure , try create something deep relationship DiCaprio Cotillard 's pathetic , amateurish stereotypic . kid ' back see often get viewer 's nerves.2 . music Hans Zimmer torture . 's loud indifferent head ringing end . 3 . dramaturgy completely neglected . One destruction-scene follows next ; one pursuit-scene follows next ! end ! big disaster : 's like video game , ego-shooter . 's stupid . Almost propaganda war.4 . , Nolan make movie `` intelligent complex '' . know M. Nolan intellectual deep mean emotionless confusing plot ? 5 . Nolans idea enter dream somebody else bad idea exhausted . Dreams imagination , rule , bizarre strange ( ever seen film David Lynch Mr. Nolan ? like dream. ) . guy gun ? always skyscraper military base ? 's stupid . IMAGINATION , dream copy real life even WORSE reality . good thing sequence train.6 . select well actor like Michael Caine saying two line embarrassing disrespectful . Mr. Nolan capable making great movie ( Memento , Prestige ) one , poor.Your movie `` complex , intelligent deep '' superficial insult reasonably carefully viewer .
 film disappointment , little much . Basically interesting sci-fi heist premise ; Cobb ( Leonardo DiCaprio ) Arthur ( Joseph Gordon-Levitt ) partner use dream-invasion technology steal industrial secret unsuspecting mass transit passenger ( powerful people technological age would travel mass transit , one many obvious question film expects u raise ) doze . exchange immunity troubling criminal charge Cobb , agree undertake unprecedented mission : practice `` inception '' powerful business scion , plant original idea subconscious dream manipulation.All great , unfortunately none emotional weight . find look mystery Cobb exile , plot wife ( Marion Cotillard ) shared disastrous traumatic experience dream sharing . movie essentially fall apart . seems like Nolan writer never fully synthesized two dominant strain film , time emotional drama getting way heist film vice versa . point seem heist complimenting drama vice versa . fact impressive effect sequence scene Cobb show new assistant Ariadne ( Ellen Page , green hold role ) lot action becomes outright tedious , never 're `` treated '' reel ten minute numbing snow-mobile gunfight action , right point film reaching climax . start feel obligatory , Nolan good enough action director make empty content feel like fun.As basic action/heist movie sci-fi premise , still work well enough would recommend rental . Nolan work element made better film work higher level , association totem icon ( spinning wheel , etc . ) connection memory memory device identity . However piece laid , film seems overly simple mechanical . plot -- guy take job , job , get re-unite kid . Although constantly mope depression tried inception wife died , ethical moral problem thing Cillian Murphy 's character , even though nobody know real consequence could befall true motif Ken Watanabe 's character . hoping larger picture would emerge , instead film politically naive instead attempt dramatic . constant shot adorable child playing lawn made feel watching bad Spielberg film . entire emotional anchor film put shoulder cute kiddy true Spielberg fashion . n't buy ridiculous soft-target hook , whole film collapse like DiCaprio 's dream world.This n't bad stupid film , start yearn least human warmth humor , almost always missing Nolan 's film . character sincere start become suffocating , especially considering ridiculous premise taken seriously . Basically like `` Total Recall '' term idea term stupid action scene , except take hugely seriously . become better film , intelligent one .
 Perusing top 250 , shocked see list , never mind near top . make apology admitting , fell asleep numerous occasion ( though kept re-winding ) . something n't done since Transformers ( re-winding ) , despite thundering 5.1 soundtrack . movie style substance , , back one.Has need appear intelligent `` loving '' film , resulted `` Emporer 's new clothes '' atmosphere ? slip-shod writing drum-roll , sign-posted direction easily forgiven , lieu 's unique premise ?

 long remains possible spend 100 million dollar making drivel , setting aside 10 million towards advertising order tell people 's great 've spent 200 million ticket find otherwise , 'll incentive Hollywood movie-making ever improve.I 've reviewed Angelina Jolie 's latest farrago similar term . movie bizarrely assumes Cold War still remains interest anyone ( ? ) , `` Inception '' insists basically 's interesting watch people 's dream . Well , visually - `` architecture-bending '' style `` Inception '' would great appeal , maybe 60-second advert credit card mobile phone company.But visual appeal aside , `` plot '' movie much multi-layered multi- pointless . old cliché `` die dream wake '' hauled monotonous regularity , 's never applied consistently , even , care ? MUST fire machine gun someone dream ( ca n't think reason 'd really need ) , would ever run bullet ? Would n't dream ? want blow dream hotel , really NEED dream explosive ? fuse go , safe return , always light dreamy blue touchpaper stand well back ? movie 's maker assume multi-layering various dream level endlessly fascinating ( evidenced enormous running time ) , anyone ounce discernment simply become le le connected plot becomes `` deeper '' . 're childish , ill-conceived territory many movie existing `` virtual reality '' even `` holodeck '' . Simulate convincingly like , ca n't change law physic real world , 're dream , 's real need worry stabbed shot , neither viewer care whether character , aren't.The urban myth put `` Inception '' includes sort interesting unexpected ending that.For witty , snappy meditation alternative reality , try Cronenberg 's `` eXistenZ '' , ( despite fact , like , 're dreaming know , life go really slowly , like , live whole lifetime dreamy dream state , man ) try give bloated waste time miss .
 could possibly Leonardo DiCaprio . 's bit harsh  know eat  always play sanctimonious , pedantic , self-righteous know-it-all ? 's bad movie recently . `` Revolutionary Road '' potentially good movie , always come immature . `` Shutter Island '' transparent guessed ending 10 minute . , supposed `` Inception '' ... Yes , `` Inception '' , movie simplistic yawned throughout . ( lucky ) wife fell asleep claiming n't interest . claimed smart , intelligent thriller , turned usual bag gun , explosion , chase , etc . plot , paper-thin without real point , yawn-fest borrowed idea take liberally movie 've seen . 10 year really soon enough remake `` Matrix '' ( Ellen Page Neo ) ? Dennis Quaid `` Dreamscape '' far entertaining . `` Videodrome '' way complex intriguing , movie make viewer work.While acting fair enough action flick , n't much say movie . 's pretty 1-dimensional quite dumb . really irks fact told repeatedly movie complex , complicated , hard understand , etc . 's really . us nonsensical plot device ; layered dreaming , try outwit audience . completely ridiculous  n't dream within dream part dream ?  's also hard grasp . bar really low ? would audience bamboozled make movie like `` Primer '' one complex movie ever devised . Even `` Mission Impossible '' plot twist turn drivel.To honest barely okay . boring like bus-ride Nebraska . mind scene crime ? n't see much crime - folk trying get guy change mind . Big deal . Michael Caine even becoming Director 's Trademark . two minute on-screen gratuitous best , certainly requirement story.So , wrap : boring , simple-minded , dumb , nonsensical plot 'science ' barely 'fiction ' , less-than-average acting , annoying constant music people talking , convenient 'get-outs ' logic story fails , frequently .

 must admit really looking forward film big blockbuster recent year rather overrated experience . good cast good acting overly complicated script convoluted way going stuff using idea lot decent film gone . argument n't like dumb understand wash 's easy enough understand 's going 's going make much sense . One example sensible reason Leo involved domestic situation result wife 's death seems worldwide public enemy number one ? usual assembling elite team go carry usual impossible mission consequence unknown team member impact success . Well 's original.Chucking sci-fi babble story always enhance story inception idea tech talk boring nonsensical.The 'shock ' ending predictable signposted since pretty much start film overlong overcomplicated intelligent made . Like Shutter Island Leo involved film promise lot delivers great deal . spectacular set nice effect cover ordinary fun bit sci-fi nonsense passed genius . Like Avatar thinking kind genre changing piece film half decent bit entertainment linger audience get car park KFC.Thought provoking cinema seems destined left behind kind multi layered pseudo sci-fi babble look pretty clever like think .

However attractive Marion Cotillard , sub plot became irritating indeed . grenade launcher used early dream ! end , easy cop : 's dream , folks.I wo n't go cgi / scenery design . stuff good computer game designed Amiga Atari.There great potential , movie mess .
 Inception : story corporate agent trap mark engineered `` dream world '' 's oddly dreary yet deafening , populated nasty soulless projection , minute seem like hour decade , rob mark - feel nightmare 's end , find nightmare within nightmare . pretty much sum audience experience.I found Inception uninteresting , long , absolute work watch . premise great , plot least interesting , writing , plot sequence , execution poor . even cinematography greatly disappointing . 'd think deliberately constructed dream world would fantastic - merely drear , deafeningly loud , bland , stark , depressing - even monumental , decidedly Stalinist architectural quality . realize people ( supposedly ) dream black-n-white ... make almost everything grey dingy ? Virtually `` fantastic '' clip shown trailer happen first 30 minute . great ( 70+ minute ) finale visually interesting original bit 0-gravity fight-scene hall tumble around them.The climax seemed interminable , ceased suspenseful 10 minute . supporting cast - arguable exception Caine - complete cipher , mere 2-dimensional shadow could n't give damn . descent dream Limbo rescue employer made sense given explained nature dream invasion : whose dream entering ? DiCaprio 's character 's , stuck deep subconscious ? ... unless course really nightmare begin with.In end , whole movie make sense really main-character 's unending nightmare . Unfortunately , proved nightmare . know thousand brain-dead , hype-fed , viewer imagine intelligent deep , felt differently . actual nightmare interesting , le painful endure , considerably cheaper .
 really looking forward watching movie positive review , incredibly high IMDb rating raving several friend seen it.I point liked Matrix , Memento , Batman Begins Dark Knight ( although last movie quite overrated IMDb ) . also understood plot Inception start never trouble following happening 's n't `` get '' .Inception great movie even good one . plot clever inventive contrary many IMDb raters suggested interesting surprising twist . character poorly developed , viewer , n't really care happened . true `` bad guy '' root ( bad guy `` bad '' dream ) real desire see `` good guy '' succeed object entire plot seems irrelevant ( implant thought guy 's head break father 's corporation ... kid ! ) . fact everything happens dream remove sense danger risk action make seem like pointless video game , several dream appear anyway ... unimaginative repetitive . Nolan 's dream `` shoot'em '' video game ? attack hospital/mountain fortress bad get ... looked like CGI sequence Medal Honor/Call Duty.It also infuriating rule dream universe inconsistent . Creating imaginary situation normal rule n't apply OK long alternate universe function according logical rule , movie rule constantly bent accommodate need director.A example : top supposed indication Mal `` dream '' top spin forever made way ... someone else 's dream top topple since n't know dream top spin forever . indicate Dom/the viewer is/is dream/reality end scene ? ... wow , sooo deep.How finding top safe allow Dom `` incept '' Mal idea dream needed return reality ? explanation ... wow , sooo deep.In dream No.1 van fall bridge causing weightlessness dream No.2 - meaning non-physical event ( 's dream ) certain kind ( ? ) carry dream layer . dream No.2 sleeping character become weightless somehow state carry layer No.3 No.4 ... 's dream anyway care make sense ? need `` kick '' layer wake character ? weightlessness carry layer `` kick '' would logically also carry ... logic rule would n't actual physical event real world carry dream ? dream aware another reality - really another dream - dream feel effect dream although asleep unaware 's going ... wow , sooo deep.If character asleep first layer dream know happening fallen asleep thus would reason dream becoming weightless layer two sleep falling van dream ... wow , sooo deep.Since wake-up `` kick '' supposed come sensation inner ear `` kick '' real dream , conclude inner ear must `` dream '' sens imaginary kick , make sense ... wow , sooo deep . analyze logic behind dream rule must conclude entire movie dream ( nightmare ) logic applies `` dream rule '' nonsense whole movie pretext stringing together bunch unrelated `` cool '' action sequence special effect make massive Hollywood `` pseudo-intellectual '' blockbuster junk movie . movie even greater disappointment considering anticipating something better `` Matrix '' `` Sixth Sense '' . IMDb rating 9+ incomprehensible , rate 6.0-7.0 range . rating must reflect large number user getting confused rating video game.As say number positive votes/reviews indicate great movie think could likewise argue McDonald 's best food world.I rated harsh 1.0 help bring IMDb rating back earth . however mediocre movie .
 150 minute theater seemed like 1500 minutes.Great idea . Good visuals . Horrible production . , watching ? liked ? bad guy ? thing happening screen ? , long ? last never-ending sequence ice . idea why.I understand concept prepared hearing many people 'complex ' script . , plain stupid . producer money wanted use action sequence special effect . fit plot ? really . movie n't need much action , honest . movie stimulated brain , ear drums.Anyway went hype . known better . , dollar theater Sunday night Texas Rangers Steelers losing . , OK .
 start saying Inception indeed clever premise , least one sound good paper : group people steal information people 's dream hired put idea someone 's head . Cobb 's back story way haunted mental image ex-wife genuinely fascinating . However , nice , fresh idea lost hurricane absolutely awful pretentious storytelling . People often praised film clever writing , strike film deliberately trying needlessly complicated appear smarter really . say `` needlessly '' , get right , overall plot Inception complex , film come across pretentious.One first problem film something thought present Christopher Nolan 's Batman film lesser extent ( film benefit straightforward story line memorable character ) : presented concept could never happen real life . 's problem . problem film delivers ludicrous plot straight-faced dead serious manner break willing suspension disbelief . film took slightly le seriously , might wonder much technology travel someone 's dream came , , begs explanation . film n't trying realistic atmosphere , might buy injecting chemical arm , dream chemical travel dream within dream , , come across absolute nonsense.None character film , possible exception Cobb , Mal Fischer , interesting memorable least . fact , character n't really even feel like people much feel like soulless chess piece exist purpose advancing plot . result , could cared le happening film , towards action sequence end , verge falling asleep . 'm sorry , watching people personality battling generic gun wielding mass ( , stunning lack originality , apparently supposed represent Fischer 's subconscious ) n't entertaining.Bottom line , Inception boring , pretentious rather nonsensical film . nice premise sound good paper , really expected like , found letdown .
 Dumb ! Dumb ! Dumb ! enough DUMS ! make feel sure greatest film 21st century , Christpher Nolan 's multi-layered visionary masterpiece ? ? Dumb ! Dumb ! Dumb ! Come !

's trick seems worked people wander cinema like wide eyed happy zombie , eager write adoring review IMDb give praise Christopher Nolan basically attained status God , n't work . n't know , reason idea film mesmeric piece shimmering cinematic brilliance n't 'incepted ' mind.Actually know . 's n't mesmeric piece shimmering cinematic brilliance 's two half hour sheer unadulterated boredom . 's character development . drama unengaging . action sequence bizarrely devoid tension . 's uninvolving . character waffle n't care 're saying . gunfight sequence tedious . enemy character frequently fire burst round never manage hit anyone despite ample opportunity . many time Nolan think 's great idea show character floating around hotel corridor fighting 'projections ' ? someone please tell ca n't prove world 's made best film ever going Dumb ! Dumb ! Dumb ! . Except apparently can.The basic idea potential make stunning film many people think , Nolan waste opportunity dull storyline . Getting business man split company ? exciting thing could think ? Could n't get president decide launch nuclear attack something ? something mundane ? weighs film abundance developed material fails create sense danger fights.Why everyone think film good ? People n't seem able tell difference film try fantastic fails , film fantastic.Good thing ? yes 's lot money spent . striking image . Ellen Page super pretty ... erm ...
 ca n't believe movie voted # 4 best movie , movie start interesting topic truly hoped amazing , sophisticated well executed movie ... , story could sublime however execution clumsy , director tried hard wanted movie big . beside dream , movie nothing collage scene major capitol city ; crime involves rich person dying ; repetitive , half as architectural interior design , course , endless people car chasing plus everlasting fights..this movie combo many movie , n't need see movie seen following : 80 's James Bonds , League Extraordinary Gentlemen , Memento , butterfly effect , Ronin , day tomorrow ( another really lousy movie ) ... , worst thing many scene Inception quite directly replicated movies.the art design movie terrible , see art director know M.C . Escher may consult mediocre architect , highly recommend try acid simply ask people dream like.by way , theater seeing movie , felt annoyed every time see logo , especially seeing logo Hyundai thousand time , started thinking much money Hyundai endorse forgot car chasing still going ! Also keep wondering : considering 5 minute equal one hour per layer dream , people feel thirsty wanting go bathroom 50 year long dream ? people saying imagination appreciate movie , truly believe people finding excuse movie . sorry ca n't stare pile crap imagine 's filet mignon : p
 really anything new add . negative review already posted say . thought movie good , probably get . know sucked , understood perfectly well . biggest waste time since Leonard part 6 . dream dream dream dream , alone way make movie complicated good . Well crap , say review ten line , go . used website long time first review ever done . reason felt compelled seeing highly rated stupid movie . loved movie `` complex storyline , '' go ahead , turn spike TV wait wwe wrestle mania come write gushing 10 star review complex storyline butt kicking inside butt kicking inside butt kicking inside butt kicking .
 movie come close Matrix . sad ranked highly IMDb list.This simply action movie . decent one , maybe , many movie like , really . Perhaps one difference movie philosophical side ( albeit junior high school level , `` dream ? '' type ) . wonder thousand viewer gave 10 movie liked movie much . guy UK : ) ? ! also bothered multitude inconsistency movie . example , husband wife spend 50 year dream , mean must third higher level dream , require according movie heavy chemical prevents waking case death . commit suicide wake instead sending Limbo , later told movie case kind drug used . another example , lack gravity felt first level dream , second level van falling .
 movie terrible . tried something ground breaking emotionally challenging , fell terribly short front , starting basic premise . expected believe group people smart enough construct elaborate plot involving breaking people 's dream smart enough reunite man family without getting stopped custom ? 's stupid . Fly Mexico walk . fly kid . giant plot hole unfathomably stupid , dialogue two half hour nightmare . think personal favorite line movie DiCaprio 's character told dream wife could justice could remember perfection imperfection . ca n't stupid . movie probably mindblowingly deep meaningful education stopped grade school , least GED , n't waste ten buck .
 n't actually consider awful film felt note restraint applied gushing superlative thus far enjoyed film simply n't deserve them.It decent story reasonably well told . direction intelligent probably led nose script le demand sensational action sequence often contrived drama emotion.Leonardo DiCaprio coast film perfunctory performance left caring little character . supporting cast , , perform well enough nothing ordinary.The special effect spectacular beautifully choreographed one ca n't help feeling many younger reviewer seduced successfully.It good film certainly entertaining , time , muddled time time one could n't help thinking , 'why n't use hypnosis ' suggestive technique . seemed long way short cut.I perhaps churlish respect since one ought suspend belief degree watching sort simplistic , banal sci fi fairy tale . One reviewer reckoned 'The French Connection ' 'The Godfather ' . long , long way short .
 reading nothing good review Inception past week , knew minute saw trailer , see movie n't know expect . seen trailer movie , know n't explain much . saw Inception today say : Wow ! incredible cast amazing director , ca n't go wrong . Inception movie make think start whole conversation saw screen . 's clever story told skill passion , pay attention , loved made think . One friend saw premiere told would see understand , n't get saw today . would love see movie , problem . performance , story , sound , editing incredible effect , would love watch movie , 's favorite film year far.Dom Cobb skilled thief , absolute best dangerous art extraction , stealing valuable secret deep within subconscious dream state , mind vulnerable . Cobbs rare ability made coveted player treacherous new world corporate espionage , also made international fugitive cost everything ever loved . Cobb offered chance redemption . One last job could give life back accomplish impossible inception . gather group thief pull incredible mission , teaching new comer , Ariadne amazing world alter liking , gone deep making dream something strange , could get lost play limbo reality dream . Even lesson , instead perfect heist , Cobb team specialist pull reverse : task steal idea plant one.To write dream riddle , love way movie written . Christopher Nolan one new favorite director , know exactly write tell story . small flaw , small complaint , story 're incredible , also bit exhausting . film bit long warn advance , 's little two half hour long . felt like couple thing story could trimmed , like said 's small complaint Inception intrigued much . say film contender Oscars pretty much guarantee sound , script , editing effect . Hopefully think might runner best picture.One thing hate review brag movie n't want others get hyped film disappointed see . honestly , n't think n't one person would n't recommend movie . Inception incredible effect mixing Matrix Dark Knight , think `` Zero Gravity '' fight scene one amazing moment 've seen big screen . loved story kept thinking going , guessing would happen next going . dream within dream within dream , even begin question character dream reality . great cast excellent director , Inception everything wanted , , Nolan created masterpiece . Something mind , Inception question ' make wonder world part of.10/10
 Everyone telling movie complex , confusing . really need pay attention 'll get lost.I dosed middle still knew exactly happening.This movie nothing cross Matix , Dreamscape , Mission Impossible 3 movie anime film coming since mid 1980 's . ending obvious outcome could , already know n't except dream version wife would gone . kid getting home see face , real focus . missed beginning seeing father-in-law pick airport final tip off.Most people ask missed ; could n't even tell dream . think 's scare , people think take real intelligence follow.Maybe attention deficit Oh wait still trouble following rated boring movie.I gave movie 4 10 star special effect , story line acting give 2 star
 Well , agree site , came searching Inception : `` Inception ' win informal poll overrated movie 2010 . '' n't get . saw ( fortunately $ 4.99 Demand ) : - Great special effect , mostly beginning movie . - interesting psychological plot manipulating guy 's mind . - incredibly long middle sequence one guy moving around unconscious body , interspersed equally incredibly boring scene shooting fighting mountain - world necessary ? Without hour spent totally unnecessary footage , would much better movie . almost killed showed first shot van started falling . guess director took idea 5 minute real time/1 hour dream time painfully literally . - plot guy wife ( SPOILER ALERT ) totally predictable saw Shutter Island Memento , took Psych 101 . - cast acted reasonably well , whose character n't care about.So n't get 's popular . think would liked lot ruthlessly edited hour half , wife plot something different change . 'm getting tired one.I know 'll get lot screaming comment fan n't believe anyone different opinion , 'd like see anyone justify long middle sequence .
 `` Emperor 's New Clothes '' short tale Hans Christian Andersen two weaver promise Emperor new suit clothes invisible unfit position , stupid , incompetent . Emperor parade subject new clothes , child cry , `` n't wearing anything ! '' Personally , find movie utter waste time recourses.Am child above-mentioned tale ? intellectual enough understand marvelous gem : Inception ? perhaps majority user forum scared submitting negative review , might regarded others stupid able comprehend intellectualism movie.PS : watched movie two part ( long boring ) managed fell asleep occasion .
 competent movie somehow gotten ridiculous amount praise . felt everything movie average , sick berated refusing say movie anything le perfect . decent premise , well acted , long slow . Unfortunately movie riddled mistake subplot wife could much interesting barely getting look . good moment , enough make long me.Also , , kid age end film ? n't mean dream ending ( saw coming soon introduced spinning top way ) pointless kid n't aged , must dream.Do n't believe hype !
 movie cascade factual error logical error . foundation movie totally wrong mistaken , movie make sense all.Nolan done research `` Lucid Dreaming '' get fact straight . Reading one book would sufficed ( Lucid Dreaming , Steven Laberge ) .Were movie brilliantly succeed ( Dreamscape , Matrix , Existenz possibly others ) , Inception miserably fails ... people know little dreaming , movie may seem great , , movie joke . Really bad , ca n't understand writer / director totally ruin potentially great idea concept .
 important thing start distance hype film help watching , totally justified . seems mainstream film ( especially summertime ) manages least something different clever hailed masterpiece simply Transformers 2 . watching expecting amazed probably wrong state mind . Likewise probably great expecting something impossible follow , film clearly constructed even action occurring across several `` level '' , still found easy follow.The film thriller , like many great thriller one built imaginative clever concept . world dream infiltration well constructed also well delivered audience ; people near muttering asking confused question throughout , personally found easy follow part  'm smart film good job bringing viewer idea concept . term action movie , second half film pick well race time across dream level , editing bringing together well n't lose happening indeed movement time importance relative event clearly understood produce tension . Although dream world bit `` ordinary '' time ( dream filled thing n't make sense echo thing , rather detailed cityscape gun battle ) creativity visual design particular Matrix-esquire battle spinning corridor thrilling watch.To credit stepping action aspect mean idea got u abandoned . importance Cobb 's subconscious particular gnawing guilt death wife initially appears way repeatable `` baddie '' turning various place throughout film , actually well used introduce doubt alternative interpretation film . everywhere else , ending film met groan would confirmation ending . Personally think `` real level actually dream '' idea planted director keep audience simply finishing film walking away presented reality actual reality . understand disliked could appear like Nolan going `` ? '' without providing much question , choose see another tease , perfectly allowed since whole film trying get others doubt reality change mind ( although really ) .The cast deliver well . DiCaprio manages produce engaging character emotionally make sense performance help deeper material subconscious work well accessible viewer . Gordon-Levitt memorable action scene also good presence generally even lot le . Page provides viewer someone `` come '' work angle well . Hardy , Watanabe Rao round team well . bigger name potential distraction virtue `` oh look x '' Caine , Berenger , Haas Postlethwaite n't really even actual screen time minimal compared recognisability face . Cotillard work well character vary across level context liked better thought would.I 'm agreement Inception classic perfect film good one . anything elevation film average uninspiring vast majority film released , suppose success one good thing way maybe counter . concept idea well constructed presented audience film hard follow challenge viewer one thing blockbuster normally n't  pay attention . n't quite live hype still good engaging film .
 , unfortunately , cinematic catastrophe , expectation might like original film year might open new page sci-fi genre , proved completely utterly misconceived , say least . simply overrated film Nolan 's Dark Knight , supposedly intended represent pinnacle intellectualism , originality , idea never even hinted . , , nothing two half hour utter sheer nonsense , real viewing terror , debasement genre ! limitless realm quasi-Freudian , Yungian ? , philosophy , e.g. , dream fixing , main actor faced difficult task deciphering way create dream within dream within dream , expect see true scary Freudian element dream symbolism destruction , God Forbid , sex , , left cold foot dangling aforementioned 'within loop ' , sexuality , know , source modern evil , film intended sundry , e.g . like pleasant , 'wellness ' relaxation really exhausting 3-hour shopping spree , family must let steam nearby cinema , , voila , Inception correctly calibrated dose illogical shooting explosion ( least got see technology weapon Alpine unit today use ) , , yes , DiCaprio survives , everybody else fare , fear , Nolan ! , damn time , wo n't follow film 's logic , 140 minute heck time kill boiling fury total waste money , time personal dignity .

 review call `` genius '' ridiculous . plot overwhelmingly incredulous even open minded movie goer would find plain brain dead.I love long mundane review `` work art '' / '' masterpiece '' . much fool paid write garbage.Half son summed best asked `` dad , almost done yet ?

 People must gone insane ! ! ! usually n't give opinion blog , forum etc . make feel like dog barking dark unknown stranger . n't like registration form survey marketing bullshit tool site like using . ... film absurd rating provoked much brake principle . seen LOT movie .

Despite `` layer '' , special effect , computer graphic multimillion dollar budget , movie simply flat , pointless , boring even entertaining bullshit . insult , 's made elementary school kid , us language , verbally explains every step like mute film twenty , pretend high class entertainment smart people . Yesterday watched 4 5 European South American movie . None budget higher 15 million dollar . Inception n't worth even tenth worst 160 million dollar budget . Apart special effect n't see anything good . Acting bad , dialogue worse , entertainment zero . actually forcing watching waiting see point ... Could n't bear anymore watch showed 50 minute passed . love Science Fiction movie . even time time enjoy watching B rate movie , make relax give 2 hour entertainment away everyday stress . one made checking watch every 2 minute see would finally end ... Basta ! ! ! n't waste time money !
 n't get positive review movie . found overlong could find reason care character . Technically speaking , true heroic character , bunch technologically-advanced criminal victim . several point movie pleading `` Go home ! Go home ! '' decent idea think Rod Serling ( RIP ) probably could done much better job would done shorter time . really think writer producer could made tighter film better interesting character . Christopher Nolan terrific , terrific work Batman Begins Dark Knight , film unworthy success .
 title pretty much sum movie . absolutely amazing cast incredible premise almost wholly pushed margin special effect `` action '' . hope high . Nolan clearly depth far intellect go totally blew chance pull epic , unprecedented dream heist flick.Dear Nolan , 're reading : give gun , grenade launcher C4 cast unknown actor , place virtually anywhere destroy everything sight two hour , would good movie.Thanks ripping luring allure promised slick corporate spy engaged mind game surreal setting instead taking promising half-way point senseless visceral joyride quite literally cinematic equivalent van Gogh painting Starry Night taking bowie slashing ribbon paint chance dry.It 's painfully clear wrote script allow stroke ego over-the-top action flick could cook . money spent great actor employed , could hired dozen great writer develop script would actually worthy talent . sir , simply WASTED . actually feel embarrassed Michael Caine . fine actor dragged crap sad . could flashed still photograph face frame would sufficed since n't pause even second develop character except Cobb anyone half brain probably wondering character development scant film deal heavily subconscious mind . , guess car chase important . 's entirely beyond tainted ego-stroking action flick genuinely thought-provoking premise `` smart part '' flew head target audience wide berth.tl ; dr version : shallow , pseudointellectualist excuse making obscene , self-gratifying action flick . hope god get money 's worth actually pay see garbage .
 could explain device drive action , would take away job archetype film 's job endlessly spout exposition explain nonsensical unaffecting action see screen.If think one level action clichés enough rot brain sub-100 IQ level , imagine SEVERAL level action clichés , explained `` hey n't interesting 've created world explain get back gunfight dreamworld '' .I 'd probably put one empty viewing experience 've ever 40 year movie-going . want money 120 minute ( left early ) back .
 Contrary opinion deluded army comic reading Nolan fanboy geek descended IMDb , Christopher Nolan entirely irrevocably disappeared self inflated backside movie . say Emperors New Clothes director sneer anyone n't understand film thus created perfect defence mechanism . 'm sure Di Caprio et al depth briefing narrative explain verbatim u viewer left work . 's full hole , full irrelevant tripe full n't easy . 's incredible voted 3rd best film time IMDb user . mean seriously , 's joke . fanboys want laud Nolan new Kubrick ( another joke ) voted tosh Kubricks work . 's smug self congratulatory film get go get smugger time drag on.Now course appreciate go far explaining every detail viewer unnecessary script mechanic insult viewer intelligence . However , although go far explaining , also go far explaining expect viewer grasp single viewing massively complex concept film - one 's badly flawed many area undermine whole 'intellectual ' nature . idea film OK film moment many scene n't make sense spoil entirely . appreciate 'heist ' movie usually procedural Nolan wanted avoid 's created self-indulgent picture ever.I could go snow scene , thoroughly implausible way people 'assemble ' team , oh-I'm-Christoper-so-considerably-cleverer-than-you-are-Nolan backstory Di Caprio 's wife 'm going pick apart scene 'd hour n't got energy left enduring nonsense . Besides ; everything could spun meant ( n't deep like think ) . Inception fur coat knickers . explains little going left feeling angry . generally get film 's case moronic fool struggle follow weather . billed completely original idea ? Nah . 's obvious similarity Matrix , Dreamscape , Total Recall , Flatliners , Vanilla Sky , Pan 's Labyrinth , Dream Demon even one Star Trek Next Generation Episodes centred around holodeck , 've 'gotten ' - good one , bad one , one ponder day afterwards . fact abomination simply ca n't bothered think really n't care . n't care character , n't care ending ( excruciatingly predictable ) n't care clever Nolan think . 're mate . 've pulled massive con film creating movie call people stupid n't get / like . get sneer snigger stupid little people . 've taken previous success movie exec 've foolishly allowed fund rampant self indulgence . 's irritates utter piffle . understood understandable film course film intention purposely let viewer fill gap imagination ( generally nice touch ) simply n't case . story script indeed awful acting ( outside Di Caprio , Juno girl Cillian Murphy ) neither hold together paper crack weak script 's trying oh deep ... badly failing.This 120 minute life never ever get back simply could n't wait film end . lost interest character , backstorys indeed 'mission ' hour woke fact clearly unable pull film together something coherent genuinely contemplative . judging rest audience people , n't person left feeling bitterly cheated . congratulate Nolan creating hysteria , mass hypnosis hype 's clearly managed brainwash lot audience making think 've seen clever film . 's inception.Go see insidious fluff visual experience perhaps ( even ; visually 's pretty overrated ) . n't surprised feel strange peer group pressure tell whoever go see understood probably n't ( ; actually care spite dumb script ) .Nolan ever Kubrick . Kubrick would done film justice - rewritten script , changed half cast , removed 45 minute length replaced sensible content made film engaging cohesive . fear next set people duped vote trite idiocy come Oscars.BTW wager Nolan watched Guy Ritchies Revolver liked . Congratulations Christopher , descended level filmmaking.Meh .
 Based review hoping `` different '' American film sense substance , subtlety make think . , . typical Hollywood flick car chase , shooting galore , explosion , fistfight , pretty boy girl - whole nine yard sell ticket ADHD generation teenager . gave 3 star - instead 2 - special effect absolutely astonishing . film wish clever really make lot sense either . reminded teachers/professors confusing purpose order make u believe smarter .
 lot talented actor nice visual effect . Sadly could get story movie trying convey . n't make sense me.Leonardo two flop saw within year Shutter Island.. would n't waste time trying watch either movie . closing always like see Ken Watanabe.Some movie similar really liked Matrix Fountain . movie nowhere near caliber movie find hard compare movie anything , way - WAY rated . really liked movie Knight Day Tom Cruise recommend also Resident Evil : Afterlife Milla Jovovich .
 **Only teeny spoiler** Well , say ? Inception overrated movie 've seen year . plot hole string vest.I found first 20 min dull best , easily distracted ( actually paused film ordered pizza/had look Twitter/read another message board ... ) . even restarted film give another chance , avail.Then whole 20 min , managed keep attention leaving thinking 'why watching ? ' next hour . finally gave 45 min go turned Bond movie snow skiing chase appeared nowhere.I n't give toss character nothing make want care , plot n't fill minute 145 min stayed bar nice CGI trick - ca n't say anything done better movie many time great deal le time.Give Total Recall dream based plot action day week.The acting average , architect looked 17yrs old yet somehow became instant expert dreams/psychology managed smug - token precocious child writer include story dying page ? Perhaps cute pet dog would helped here.It n't often switch film think pointless carry . Inception n't even annoy enough see happened end - simply n't care . getting anything 6/10 beyond . gave 4/10 even think 'm generous - n't even score Bad 's Good chart .
 Inception - saw ago . write , South Park making fun last night . never got enthusiasm flick . somewhat entertaining , although , certainly mind blowing even inventive . 've seen mind bending thing Outer Limits 60 's . memorable . fact , forgotten last night . One thing remember poorly Ellen Page 's character rounded . remember laughing , - part play , Ms. Exposition . Explain everything , audience know going . action cliché , left wanting . whole thing going someone 's dream silly , funny silly - lead ... South Park , hand . lot fun . Throw Sheep Herder , young Mr. Mackey , random pizza delivery guy , even retired Freddy Kruger 've got entertaining 22 minute . , course , Randy Marsh . Stan trapped Mr. Mackey 's dream , Randy go save . Stan see dad dream . dad come dream Butterfly . Stan say `` come help ? '' Randy reply `` gon na ... Butterflies concern thing , Stan . 'm gon na go find butterfly poon . '' much better watching inception .
